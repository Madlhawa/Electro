GND Ground. Port A (PA2..PA0) Port A is a 3-bit bi-directional I/O port with internal pull-up resistors (selected for each bit). The Port A output buffers have symmetrical drive characteristics with both high sink and source capability. As inputs, Port A pins that are externally pulled low will source current if the pull-up resistors are activated. The Port A pins are tri-stated when a reset condition becomes active, even if the clock is not running. Port A also serves the functions of various special features of the ATtiny2313 as listed on page 53. Port B (PB7..PB0) Port B is an 8-bit bi-directional I/O port with internal pull-up resistors (selected for each bit). The Port B output buffers have symmetrical drive characteristics with both high sink and source capability. As inputs, Port B pins that are externally pulled low will source current if the pull-up resistors are activated. The Port B pins are tri-stated when a reset condition becomes active, even if the clock is not running. Port B also serves the functions of various special features of the ATtiny2313 as listed on page 53. Port D (PD6..PD0) Port D is a 7-bit bi-directional I/O port with internal pull-up resistors (selected for each bit). The Port D output buffers have symmetrical drive characteristics with both high sink and source capability. As inputs, Port D pins that are externally pulled low will source current if the pull-up resistors are activated. The Port D pins are tri-stated when a reset condition becomes active, even if the clock is not running. Port D also serves the functions of various special features of the ATtiny2313 as listed on page 56. RESET Reset input. A low level on this pin for longer than the minimum pulse length will generate a reset, even if the clock is not running. The minimum pulse length is given in Table 15 on page 34. Shorter pulses are not guaranteed to generate a reset. The Reset Input is an alternate function for PA2 and dW. XTAL1 Input to the inverting Oscillator amplifier and input to the internal clock operating circuit. XTAL1 is an alternate function for PA0. XTAL2 Output from the inverting Oscillator amplifier. XTAL2 is an alternate function for PA1. General Information Resources A comprehensive set of development tools, application notes and datasheets are available for downloadon http://www.atmel.com/avr.

{"title": "Arduino Leonardo WITHOUT Headers(Original)", "price": 3450.0, "description": "The latest addition to the Arduino family is here! The Arduino Leonardo is a microcontroller board based on the exciting USB-enabled ATmega32u4 (). This chip has about the same amount of flash, RAM and capability as the ATmega328 found in the UNO. It has 20 digital input/output pins (of which 7 can be used as PWM outputs and 12 as analog inputs), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a micro USB connection, a spot for a 2.1mm power jack, an ICSP header breakout, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable to get started. The Leonardo differs from all preceding boards in that the ATmega32u4 has built-in USB communication, eliminating the need for a secondary chip (such as an FTDI friend, FTDI cable or the USB/Serial converter on the UNO). On one hand this means that sketches on the Leo are a little bigger because it's also handling USB interaction. On the other hand, it allows the Leonardo to appear to a connected computer as a mouse and/or keyboard, in addition to a virtual (CDC) serial / COM port. It also has other implications for the behavior of the board; these are detailed on the We're very excited to have a small shipment of Leo's in stock. Please note that this board is very new and so is as there may be a bug that trips up beginners. . We haven't gone through and tested it with all the Adafruit shields and don't guarantee it will work until we've sat down and done a lot of testing and coding, so keep that in mind! This board is only supported in the latest Arduino IDE 1.0.1 so you will also need to update the IDE.", "img": null, "url": "https://www.lankatronics.com/development-tools/original-arduino-leonardo.html", "location": "online"},

We had these custom made specifically for use with embedded Linux machines like the Pi. It provides clean 1A minimum with 5.25V to overcome the 0.25V drop of the USB cable - The easiest method by far to talk to the Pi - simply connect the black, green and white wires to the GPIO header and connect using a terminal program! Connect the red wire to also provide power. - 2GB is a little too small, we think. This card works perfectly with our reader below and is ideal for loading in our educational Pi distro - We now have this part pre-assembled so you don't have to solder it! Makes connecting to the GPIO/I2C/SPI/Power pins easy as pie, for Model B Revision 1.0 - For loading the image onto the SD card. No drivers required, works with all OS's and is plenty fast - This breadboard has plenty of space for a Cobbler and your circuits, with an adhesive back you can attach it. We now ship white breadboards, not clear ones - These flexible wires come in various colors and are easier to use than 'cut wire' kits - The Pi comes with built in Ethernet, so use it to make your project net-connected - beautiful jewel-tone embroided badges are made with solar power and are iron on. Adafruit supports the Raspberry Pi foundation with donations and have permission to make these badges.- BONUS PARTS!

To use a sensor, you must first charge the output node by applying a voltage to its OUT pin. You can then read the reflectance by withdrawing the externally supplied voltage and timing how long it takes the output voltage to decay due to the integrated phototransistor. Shorter decay time is an indication of greater reflection.

{"title": "DRV8825 3D Printer RAMPS1.4 RepRap StepStick Stepper Motor Driver", "price": 425.0, "description": "The DRV8825 stepper motor driver carrier is a breakout board for TI's DRV8825 microstepping bipolar stepper motor driver. The module has a pinout and interface that are nearly identical to those of our A4988 stepper motor driver board, so it can be used as a higher-performance drop-in replacement for those boards in many applications.The DRV8825 features adjustable current limiting, overcurrent and overtemperature protection, and six microstep resolutions (down to 1/32-step). It operates from 8.2 \u2013 45 V and can deliver up to approximately 1.5 A per phase without a heat sink or forced air flow (rated for up to 2.2 A per coil with sufficient additional cooling).1)Simple step and direction control interface2)Six different step resolutions: full-step, half-step, 1/4-step, 1/8-step, 1/16-step, and 1/32-step3)Adjustable current control lets you set the maximum current output with a potentiometer, which lets you use voltages above your stepper motor's rated voltage to achieve higher step rates4)45 V maximum supply voltage5)Built-in regulator (no external logic voltage supply needed)6)Can interface directly with 3.3 V and 5 V systems7)Over-temperature thermal shutdown, over-current shutdown, and under-voltage lockout8)Short-to-ground and shorted-load protection9)4-layer, 2 oz copper PCB for improved heat dissipation10)Exposed solderable ground pad below the driver IC on the bottom of the PCB11)Module size, pinout, and interface match those of our A4988 stepper motor driver carriers in most respects (see the bottom of this page for more information)This product is a carrier board or breakout board for TI\u2019s DRV8825 stepper motor driver; we therefore recommend careful reading of the DRV8825 datasheet (1MB pdf) before using this product. This stepper motor driver lets you control one bipolar stepper motor at up to 2.2 A output current per coil (see the Power Dissipation Considerations section below for more information). Here are some of the driver\u2019s key features:Simple step and direction control interfaceSix different step resolutions: full-step, half-step, 1/4-step, 1/8-step, 1/16-step, and 1/32-stepAdjustable current control lets you set the maximum current output with a potentiometer, which lets you use voltages above your stepper motor\u2019s rated voltage to achieve higher step ratesIntelligent chopping control that automatically selects the correct current decay mode (fast decay or slow decay)45 V maximum supply voltageBuilt-in regulator (no external logic voltage supply needed)Can interface directly with 3.3 V and 5 V systemsOver-temperature thermal shutdown, over-current shutdown, and under-voltage lockoutShort-to-ground and shorted-load protection4-layer, 2 oz copper PCB for improved heat dissipationExposed solderable ground pad below the driver IC on the bottom of the PCBModule size, pinout, and interface match those of our A4988 stepper motor driver carriers in most respects (see the bottom of this page for more information)We also carry a DRV8824 stepper motor driver carrier that can serve as a direct substitute for the DRV8825 carrier when using lower-current stepper motors. The DRV8824 can only deliver up to 0.75 A per coil without a heat sink (1.2 A max with proper cooling), but it has larger current-sense resistors that allow for better microstepping performance than the DRV8825 carrier at low currents. The only way to tell our DRV8824 carrier apart from the DRV8825 carrier is by the markings on the driver IC; if you have a mix of the two, you might consider marking them (there is a blank square on the bottom silkscreen you can use for this). For lower-voltage applications, consider our pin-compatible DRV8834 carrier, which works with motor supply voltages as low as 2.5 V.", "img": null, "url": "https://www.lankatronics.com/modules-sensors/drv8825-3d-printer-ramps1-4-reprap-stepstick-stepper-motor-driver.html", "location": "online"},
