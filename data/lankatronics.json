{"title": "Teensy-LC Without Pins", "condition": "New", "description": "Teensy-LC (Low Cost) is a powerful 32 bit microcontroller board, with a rich set of hardware peripherals, at a very affordable price! Teensy-LC delivers an impressive collection of capabilities to make modern electronic projects simpler. It features an ARM Cortex-M0+ processor at 48 MHz, 62K Flash, 8K RAM, 12 bit analog input & output, hardware Serial, SPI & I2C, USB, and a total of 27 I/O pins. See the technical specifications and pinouts for details. Teensy-LC maintains the same form-factor as Teensy 3.1, with most pins offering similar peripheral features. Real Hardware Serial Most modern projects involve serial communication with sensors, other chips, other systems, or even the internet. Hardware serial ports greatly simplify projects and enable excellent performance. Teensy-LC provide plenty of serial connectivity: 2 SPI ports, 2 I2C, and 3 Serial ports. All 3 serial ports are supported by high quality drivers in Teensyduino, with both transmit and receive buffering, and even support for RS485 transmitter enable. Teensy-LC will be ideal for inexpensive \"Internet Of Things\" projects when paired with a ESP8266 Wifi module, which requires a fast hardware serial or SPI port. Efficient USB Communication Teensy-LC has the same powerful USB hardware as Teensy 3.1. All USB data transfer is done directly to memory with minimal CPU overhead. Teensy-LC supports USB Serial, MIDI, Keyboard (international layouts), Mouse, Joystick, and RawHID protocols. A full set of 16 bidirectional USB endpoints are supported by the hardware, allowing any type of USB device. As more USB protocols are added to Teensyduino, despite its low cost, Teensy-LC will be up the task. Hardware Timers Many Arduino libraries require a hardware timer. Traditional Arduino products have 3 or 4 timers, with only 1 or 2 providing more than 8 bit resolution. Teensy-LC has a total of 7 timers, all of them with 16 or more bits of resolution, to allow excellent compatibility with easy-to-use libraries. Many combinations of popular libraries, which would normally conflict, can seamlessly run together on Teensy LC and Teensy 3.1. Analog Input & Output at 12 Bit Resolution Analog signals are critically important to many projects. Teensy-LC has 13 pins than can function as analog inputs. The effective analog resolution is 12 bits. It also has a true 12 bit digital to analog converter, for an analog output signal. 32 bit ARM Cortex M0+ Processor The Cortex-M0+ processor is a powerful, full 32 bit CPU, designed for lower power, lower cost devices. Cortex-M0+ has fewer instructions and a simpler bus structure than the more powerful Cortex-M4 on Teensy 3.1. For simple code, M0+ often runs at similar speed, when running at the same clock frequency. For math-intensive applications, Cortex-M4 can be significantly faster, and of course it supports higher clock rates. Cortex-M0+ at 48 MHz is much faster than 8 bit AVR processors at 16 MHz, especially when manipulating 16 and 32 bit variables! 5 Volt Buffer For WS2812/NeoPixel LED Projects Teensy-LC provides a 5V output to directly drive WS2812/NeoPixel LEDs. A 74LV1T125 buffer is connected to pin 17, with the increased output voltage available on another pin.

{"title": "QTR-3RC Reflectance Sensor Array-POLOLU", "condition": "New", "description": "Functional Description The QTR-3RC reflectance sensor array is intended as a line sensor, but it can be used as a general-purpose proximity or reflectance sensor. The module is a convenient carrier for three IR emitter and receiver (phototransistor) pairs. With sensors spaced at intervals of 0.375\u2032\u2032 (9.525 mm) along of the board\u2019s longer axis, this array works well as a minimal detector for line-following robots, as line-following courses are commonly made using 3/4\u2032\u2032 (19 mm) black electrical tape. The middle sensor is slightly offset along the short axis of the board. To use a sensor, you must first charge the output node by applying a voltage to its OUT pin. You can then read the reflectance by withdrawing the externally supplied voltage and timing how long it takes the output voltage to decay due to the integrated phototransistor. Shorter decay time is an indication of greater reflection. This measurement approach has several advantages, especially when multiple units are used: No analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is required Improved sensitivity over voltage-divider analog output Parallel reading of multiple sensors is possible with most microcontrollers The LED current-limiting resistors are set to deliver approximately 17 mA to the LEDs when VCC is 5 V, making the total board consumption just over 50 mA. The schematic diagram of the module is shown below: This schematic is also available as a downloadable pdf (117k pdf). For an alternative array with eight sensors and the ability to turn off the IR LEDs to limit power consumption, consider our QTR-8RC reflectance sensor array. For individual reflectance sensors, consider our QTR-1RC and QTR-L-1RC. QTR sensor size comparison. Clockwise from top left: QTR-3RC, QTR-1RC, QTR-L-1RC, QTR-8RC.

The typical sequence for reading a sensor is: Set the I/O line to an output and drive it high. Wait several microseconds to give the 2.2 nF capacitor node time to reach 5 V. Make the I/O line an input (high impedance). Measure the time for the capacitor node voltage to decay by waiting for the I/O line to go low. These steps can typically be executed in parallel on multiple I/O lines. With a strong reflectance, the decay time can be as low as several dozen microseconds; with no reflectance, the decay time can be up to a few milliseconds. The exact time of the decay depends on your microcontroller\u2019s I/O line characteristics. Meaningful results can be available within 1 ms in typical cases (i.e. when not trying to measure subtle differences in low-reflectance scenarios), allowing up to 1 kHz sampling of all three sensors. Our Pololu AVR library provides functions that make it easy to use these sensors with our Orangutan robot controllers; please see the QTR Reflectance Sensors section of our library command reference for more information. We also have a Arduino library for these sensors. Included Components This module has two mounting holes intended for #2 screws (not included); if the mounting holes are not needed, the ends of the PCB can be ground off to make the unit even smaller (less than 1\u2032\u2032 wide).

The LEDs are controlled by a MOSFET with a gate normally pulled high, allowing the LEDs to be turned off by setting the MOSFET gate to a low voltage. Turning the LEDs off might be advantageous for limiting power consumption when the sensors are not in use or for varying the effective brightness of the LEDs through PWM control. This sensor was designed to be used with the board parallel to the surface being sensed. The LED current-limiting resistors for 5 V operation are arranged in two stages; this allows a simple bypass of one stage to enable operation at 3.3 V. The LED current is approximately 20\u201325 mA, making the total board consumption just under 100 mA. The schematic diagram of the module is shown below: For a similar array with three sensors, consider our QTR-3RC reflectance sensor array.

If lower-frequency sampling is sufficient, substantial power savings can be realized by turning off the LEDs. For example, if a 100 Hz sampling rate is acceptable, the LEDs can be off 90% of the time, lowering average current consumption from 100 mA to 10 mA.

We also have a Arduino library for these sensors. Breaking the Module in Two If you don\u2019t need or cannot fit all eight sensors, you can break off two sensors and still use all 8 sensors as two separate modules, as shown below. The PCB can be scored from both sides along the perforation and then bent until it snaps apart. Each of the two resulting pieces will function as an independent line sensor. Included Components This module ships with a 25-pin 0.1\" header strip and a 100 Ohm through-hole resistor as shown below. You can break the header strip into smaller pieces and solder them onto your reflectance sensor array as desired, or you can solder wires directly to the unit or use a right-angle header strip for a more compact installation. The pins on the module are arranged so that they can all be accessed using either an 11\u00d71 strip or an 8\u00d72 strip. The resistor is required to make the two-sensor array functional after the original eight-sensor array is broken into two pieces. This resistor is only needed once the board has been broken.

It is compatible with all Xilinx tools, including iMPACT, Chipscope, and EDK. The HS1 attaches to target boards using Digilent\u2019s 6-pin, 100-mil spaced programming header, or Xilinx\u2019s 2x7, 2mm connector (using the included adaptor). The JTAG-HS1 is powered from a PC\u2019s USB port. The HS1 can be seamlessly driven from Xilinx\u2019s iMPACT software or from Digilent\u2019s Adept software. It will be recognized as a Digilent programming cable when connected to a PC, whether or not it is attached to the target board. A separate Vdd pin is provided on the HS1 to supply JTAG signal buffers. These high speed, 24mA, three-state buffers allow target boards to use JTAG signal voltages from 1.8V to 5V, with bus speeds of up to 30MBit/sec. The HS1\u2019s Vdd pin must be tied to the same voltage supply that drives the JTAG port on the FPGA. JTAG signals are held in high-impedance except when actively driven during programming, so the JTAG bus can be shared with other devices. The HS1 uses a standard Type-A to Micro-USB cable (included with the HS1) that attaches to the end of the module opposite the system board connector. The HS1 is small and light, allowing it to be held firmly in place by the system board connector. Note for use with Adept: The JTAG-HS1 requires Adept System 2.8.1 or newer for use in Windows, and Adept Runtime 2.8.2 or newer for use in Linux.

The power source is automatically selected to the highest voltage source. The FTDI FT232RL chip on the Nano is only powered if the board is being powered over USB. As a result, when running on external (non-USB) power, the 3.3V output (which is supplied by the FTDI chip) is not available and the RX and TX LEDs will flicker if digital pins 0 or 1 are high. Memory The ATmega168 has 32 KB of flash memory for storing code (of which 2 KB is used for the bootloader); the ATmega328 has 32 KB, (also with 2 KB used for the bootloader). The ATmega328 has 1 KB of SRAM and 512 bytes of EEPROM (which can be read and written with the EEPROM library); the ATmega328 has 2 KB of SRAM and 1 KB of EEPROM. Input and Output Each of the 14 digital pins on the Nano can be used as an input or output, using pinMode(), digitalWrite(), and digitalRead() functions. They operate at 5 volts. Each pin can provide or receive a maximum of 40 mA and has an internal pull-up resistor (disconnected by default) of 20-50 kOhms. In addition, some pins have specialized functions: Serial: 0 (RX) and 1 (TX). Used to receive (RX) and transmit (TX) TTL serial data. These pins are connected to the corresponding pins of the FTDI USB-to-TTL Serial chip. External Interrupts: 2 and 3. These pins can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low value, a rising or falling edge, or a change in value. See the attachInterrupt() function for details. PWM: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11. Provide 8-bit PWM output with the analogWrite() function. SPI: 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO), 13 (SCK). These pins support SPI communication, which, although provided by the underlying hardware, is not currently included in the Arduino language. LED: 13. There is a built-in LED connected to digital pin 13. When the pin is HIGH value, the LED is on, when the pin is LOW, it\u2019s off. The Nano has 8 analog inputs, each of which provide 10 bits of resolution (i.e. 1024 different values). By default they measure from ground to 5 volts, though is it possible to change the upper end of their range using the analogReference() function. Additionally, some pins have specialized functionality: I2C: 4 (SDA) and 5 (SCL). Support I2C (TWI) communication using the Wire library (documentation on the Wiring website). There are a couple of other pins on the board: AREF. Reference voltage for the analog inputs. Used with analogReference(). Reset. Bring this line LOW to reset the microcontroller. Typically used to add a reset button to shields which block the one on the board. See also the mapping between Arduino pins and ATmega168 ports. Communication The EDArduino Nano has a number of facilities for communicating with a computer, another EDArduino, or other microcontrollers. The ATmega328 provide UART TTL (5V) serial communication, which is available on digital pins 0 (RX) and 1 (TX). An FTDI FT232RL on the board channels this serial communication over USB and the FTDI drivers (included with the EDArduino software) provide a virtual com port to software on the computer. The EDArduino software includes a serial monitor which allows simple textual data to be sent to and from the EDArduino board. The RX and TX LEDs on the board will flash when data is being transmitted via the FTDI chip and USB connection to the computer (but not for serial communication on pins 0 and 1). A SoftwareSerial library allows for serial communication on any of the Nano\u2019s digital pins. ATmega328 also support I2C (TWI) and SPI communication. The Arduino software includes a Wire library to simplify use of the I2C bus; see the documentation for details. To use the SPI communication, please see the ATmega328 datasheet. Programming The EDArduino Nano can be programmed with the Arduino software (download). Select \u201cArduino Diecimila, Duemilanove, or Nano w/ ATmega328\u2032\u2032 or \u201cArduino Duemilanove or Nano w/ ATmega328\u2032\u2032 from the Tools > Board menu (according to the microcontroller on your board). For details, see the reference and tutorials. ATmega328 on the EDArduino Nano comes preburned with a bootloader that allows you to upload new code to it without the use of an external hardware programmer. It communicates using the original STK500 protocol (reference, C header files). You can also bypass the bootloader and program the microcontroller through the ICSP (In-Circuit Serial Programming) header; see these instructions for details. Automatic (Software) Reset Rather then requiring a physical press of the reset button before an upload, the EDArduino Nano is designed in a way that allows it to be reset by software running on a connected computer. One of the hardware flow control lines (DTR) of the FT232RL is connected to the reset line of the ATmega168 or ATmega328 via a 100 nanofarad capacitor. When this line is asserted (taken low), the reset line drops long enough to reset the chip. The Arduino software uses this capability to allow you to upload code by simply pressing the upload button in the EDArduino environment. This means that the bootloader can have a shorter timeout, as the lowering of DTR can be well-coordinated with the start of the upload. This setup has other implications. When the Nano is connected to either a computer running Mac OS X or Linux, it resets each time a connection is made to it from software (via USB). For the following half-second or so, the bootloader is running on the Nano. While it is programmed to ignore malformed data (i.e. anything besides an upload of new code), it will intercept the first few bytes of data sent to the board after a connection is opened. If a sketch running on the board receives one-time configuration or other data when it first starts, make sure that the software with which it communicates waits a second after opening the connection and before sending this data.", "url": "https://www.lankatronics.com/top-brands/arduino-compatible-nano-3-0.html", "location": "online", "price": 800.0, "img": "None"},

{"title": "QTR-3A Reflectance Sensor Array-POLOLU", "condition": "New", "description": "Functional Description The QTR-3A reflectance sensor array is intended as a line sensor, but it can be used as a general-purpose proximity or reflectance sensor. The module is a convenient carrier for three IR emitter and receiver (phototransistor) pairs. With sensors spaced at intervals of 0.375\u2032\u2032 (9.525 mm) along of the board\u2019s longer axis, this array works well as a minimal detector for line-following robots, as line-following courses are commonly made using 3/4\u2032\u2032 (19 mm) black electrical tape. The middle sensor is slightly offset along the short axis of the board. Each phototransistor is connected to a pull-up resistor to form a voltage divider that produces an analog voltage output between 0 V and VCC (which is typically 5 V) as a function of the reflected IR. Lower output voltage is an indication of greater reflection. The LED current-limiting resistors are set to deliver approximately 17 mA to the LEDs when VCC is 5 V, making the total board consumption just over 50 mA. The schematic diagram of the module is shown below: This schematic is also available as a downloadable pdf (115k pdf). For an alternative array with eight sensors and the ability to turn off the IR LEDs to limit power consumption, consider our QTR-8A reflectance sensor array. For individual reflectance sensors, consider our QTR-1A and QTR-L-1A. QTR sensor size comparison. Clockwise from top left: QTR-3RC, QTR-1RC, QTR-L-1RC, QTR-8RC.

Use a comparator with an adjustable threshold to convert each analog voltage into a digital (i.e. black/white) signal that can be read by the digital I/O line of a microcontroller. Connect each output directly to a digital I/O line of a microcontroller and rely upon its internal comparator. This last method will work if you are able to get high reflectance from your white surface as depicted in the left image, but will probably fail if you have a lower-reflectance signal profile like the one on the right. (Please note that these images show the output of a QTR-1A, which uses a sensor with slightly different characteristics than the ones on the QTR-3A.) QTR-1A output 1/8\" away from a spinning white disk with a black line on it. QTR-1A output 3/8\" away from a spinning white disk with a black line on it. Our Pololu AVR library provides functions that make it easy to use these sensors with our Orangutan robot controllers; please see the QTR Reflectance Sensors section of our library command reference for more information. We also have a Arduino library for these sensors. Included Components This module has two mounting holes intended for #2 screws (not included); if the mounting holes are not needed, the ends of the PCB can be ground off to make the unit even smaller (less than 1\u2032\u2032 wide).

As the piezo film is displaced from the mechanical neutral axis, bending creates very high strain within the piezopolymer and therefore high voltages are generated. When the assembly is deflected by direct contact, the device acts as a flexible \"switch\", and the generated output is sufficient to trigger MOSFET or CMOS stages directly. If the assembly is supported by its contacts and left to vibrate \"in free space\" (with the inertia of the clamped/free beam creating bending stress), the device will behave as an accelerometer or vibration sensor. Adding mass, or altering the free length of the element by clamping, can change the resonant frequency and sensitivity of the sensor to suit specific applications. Multi-axis response can be achieved by positioning the mass off center. The LDTM-028K is a vibration sensor where the sensing element comprises a cantilever beam loaded by an additional mass to offer high sensitivity at low frequencies.

They work by having an emitter side that sends out a beam of human-invisible IR light, then a receiver across the way which is sensitive to that same light. When something passes between the two, and its not transparent to IR, then the 'beam is broken' and the receiver will let you know. Compared to PIR sensors, breakbeams are faster and allow better control of where you want to detect the motion. Compared to Sonar modules, they're less expensive. However, you do need both emitter and receiver on opposite sides of the area you want to monitor. This is the 5mm IR version. It works up to 50cm / 20\". You can power it from 3.3V or 5V, but 5V will get you better range and is what we suggest. The receiver is open collector transistor output which means that you do need a pull up resistor if you want to read a digital signal off the signal wire. Most microcontrollers have the ability to turn on a built in pull up resistor. If you do not, connect a 10K resistor between the white wire of the receiver and the red wire. If you want to control a relay or LED or whatever, it can sink up to 100mA to ground Technical Details Sensing Distance: Approx 50cm / 20\" Power Voltage: 3.3 - 5.5VDC Emitter Current Draw: 10mA @ 3.3V, 20mA @ 5V Output Current Capability of receiver: 100mA sink Transmitter/Receiver LED Angle: 10\u00b0 Response Time: <2 ms Dimensions: 20mm x 10mm x 8mm / 0.8\" x 0.4\" x 0.3\" Cable Length: 250mm / 10\" Weight (of each half): 3g", "url": "https://www.lankatronics.com/modules-sensors/ir-break-beam-sensor-5mm-leds.html", "location": "online", "price": 650.0, "img": "None"},

{"title": "Arduino LEONARDO ETH", "condition": "New", "description": "The Leonardo ETH is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega32U4 (datasheet) and the new W5500 TCP/IP Embedded Ethernet Controller (datasheet). It has 20 digital input/output pins (of which 7 can be used as PWM outputs and 12 as analog inputs), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a RJ45 connection, a micro USB connector, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.The Leonardo ETH differs from the preceding Ethernet board in that the ATmega32u4 has built-in USB communication, eliminating the need for an external USB-to-serial converter. This allows the Leonardo ETH to appear to a connected computer as a mouse and keyboard, in addition to a virtual (CDC) serial / COM port. It also has other implications for the behaviour of the board. Plus, it has the new W5500 TCP/IP Embedded Ethernet Controller onboard.An optional Power over Ethernet module can be added to the board as well.The Leonardo ETH has the same Wiznet Ethernet interface as the Ethernet Shield 2.An onboard microSD card reader, which can be used to store files for serving over the network, is accessible through the SD Library. Pin 10 is reserved for the Wiznet interface, SS for the SD card is on Pin 4. The board uses the standardized 1.0 pinout, consisting of: added SDA and SCL pins: beside the AREF pin, two TWI pins have been added. This will allow to connect the Leonardo ETH to Shields that use the I2C or TWI bus communication for their functioning. the IOREF: it allows the shields to adapt to the IO voltage level provided by the Board.

{"title": "QTR-8RC Reflectance Sensor Array-POLOLU", "condition": "New", "description": "Functional Description The QTR-8RC reflectance sensor array is intended as a line sensor, but it can be used as a general-purpose proximity or reflectance sensor. The module is a convenient carrier for eight IR emitter and receiver (phototransistor) pairs evenly spaced at intervals of 0.375\" (9.525 mm). To use a sensor, you must first charge the output node by applying a voltage to its OUT pin. You can then read the reflectance by withdrawing the externally supplied voltage and timing how long it takes the output voltage to decay due to the integrated phototransistor. Shorter decay time is an indication of greater reflection. This measurement approach has several advantages, especially when coupled with the ability of the QTR-8RC module to turn off LED power: No analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is required Improved sensitivity over voltage-divider analog output Parallel reading of multiple sensors is possible with most microcontrollers Parallel reading allows optimized use of LED power enable option The outputs are all independent, but the LEDs are arranged in pairs to halve current consumption. The LEDs are controlled by a MOSFET with a gate normally pulled high, allowing the LEDs to be turned off by setting the MOSFET gate to a low voltage. Turning the LEDs off might be advantageous for limiting power consumption when the sensors are not in use or for varying the effective brightness of the LEDs through PWM control. This sensor was designed to be used with the board parallel to the surface being sensed. The LED current-limiting resistors for 5 V operation are arranged in two stages; this allows a simple bypass of one stage to enable operation at 3.3 V. The LED current is approximately 20\u201325 mA, making the total board consumption just under 100 mA. The schematic diagram of the module is shown below: For a similar array with three sensors, consider our QTR-3RC reflectance sensor array. The sensors on the QTR-8RC are also available individually as the QTR-1RC reflectance sensor, and the QTR-L-1RC is an alternative designed to be used with the board perpendicular to the surface. QTR sensor size comparison. Clockwise from top left: QTR-3RC, QTR-1RC, QTR-L-1RC, QTR-8RC. Specifications Dimensions: 2.95\" x 0.5\" x 0.125\" (without header pins installed) Operating voltage: 3.3-5.0 V Supply current: 100 mA Output format: 8 digital I/O-compatible signals that can be read as a timed high pulse Optimal sensing distance: 0.125\" (3 mm) Maximum recommended sensing distance: 0.375\" (9.5 mm) Weight without header pins: 0.11 oz (3.09 g) QTR-1RC output (yellow) when 1/8\" above a black line and microcontroller timing of that output (blue). Interfacing the QTR-8RC Outputs to Digital I/O Lines The QTR-8RC module has eight identical sensor outputs that, like the Parallax QTI, require a digital I/O line capable of driving the output line high and then measuring the time for the output voltage to decay. The typical sequence for reading a sensor is: Turn on IR LEDs (optional). Set the I/O line to an output and drive it high. Allow at least 10 \u03bcs for the sensor output to rise. Make the I/O line an input (high impedance). Measure the time for the voltage to decay by waiting for the I/O line to go low. Turn off IR LEDs (optional). These steps can typically be executed in parallel on multiple I/O lines. With a strong reflectance, the decay time can be as low as several dozen microseconds; with no reflectance, the decay time can be up to a few milliseconds. The exact time of the decay depends on your microcontroller\u2019s I/O line characteristics. Meaningful results can be available within 1 ms in typical cases (i.e. when not trying to measure subtle differences in low-reflectance scenarios), allowing up to 1 kHz sampling of all 8 sensors. If lower-frequency sampling is sufficient, substantial power savings can be realized by turning off the LEDs. For example, if a 100 Hz sampling rate is acceptable, the LEDs can be off 90% of the time, lowering average current consumption from 100 mA to 10 mA. Our Pololu AVR library provides functions that make it easy to use these sensors with our Orangutan robot controllers; please see the QTR Reflectance Sensors section of our library command reference for more information. We also have a Arduino library for these sensors. Breaking the Module in Two If you don\u2019t need or cannot fit all eight sensors, you can break off two sensors and still use all 8 sensors as two separate modules, as shown below. The PCB can be scored from both sides along the perforation and then bent until it snaps apart. Each of the two resulting pieces will function as an independent line sensor. Included Components This module ships with a 25-pin 0.1\" header strip and a 100 Ohm through-hole resistor as shown below. You can break the header strip into smaller pieces and solder them onto your reflectance sensor array as desired, or you can solder wires directly to the unit or use a right-angle header strip for a more compact installation. The pins on the module are arranged so that they can all be accessed using either an 11\u00d71 strip or an 8\u00d72 strip. The resistor is required to make the two-sensor array functional after the original eight-sensor array is broken into two pieces. This resistor is only needed once the board has been broken. Solder the included resistor to the 2-sensor array piece as shown to make the separated piece functional.", "url": "https://www.lankatronics.com/modules-sensors/qtr-8rc-reflectance-sensor-array.html", "location": "online", "price": 2350.0, "img": "None"},

Connect each output directly to a digital I/O line of a microcontroller and rely upon its internal comparator.

{"title": "0.96\" IIC Serial 128X64 OLED Display Module", "condition": "New", "description": "What is OLED? OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) is a self light-emitting technology composed of a thin, multi-layered organic film placed between an anode and cathode. In contrast to LCD technology, OLED does not require a backlight. OLED possesses high application potential for virtually all types of displays and is regarded as the ultimate technology for the next generation of flat-panel displays. The use of OLED technology offers the following advantages for flat-panel displays? 1. A simplified manufacturing process compared to TFT-LCD . 2. Self-emitting light, in contrast to the required backlight for TFT-LCD. 3. High luminosity. 4. Lightweight and thin (less than 2 mm). 5. Capable of wide viewing angles?~180?? 6. Low operating voltage and power consumption. 7. Quick response (~ ? second level). 8. Wide range of operating temperatures (-40c to 85c). A Comparison of OLED and TFT-LCD Display Technologies How Does OLED Emit Light? OLED\"s basic structure consists of organic materials positioned between the cathode and the anode, which is composed of electric conductive transparent Indium Tin Oxide (ITO). The organic materials compose a multi-layered thin film, which includes the Hole Transporting Layer (HTL), Emission Layer (EML) and the Electron Transporting Layer (ETL). By applying the appropriate electric voltage, holes and electrons are injected into the EML from the anode and the cathode, respectively. The holes and electrons combine inside the EML to form excitons, after which electroluminescence occurs. The transfer material, emission layer material and choice of electrode are the key factors that determine the quality of OLED components. Features: Needn't backlight, the display unit can self-luminous. High resolution: 128 * 64. Viewing angle:> 160 . Supports many control chip: Fully compatible with Arduino, 51 Series, MSP430 Series, STM32 / 2, CSR IC, etc. Ultra-low power consumption: full screen lit 0.08W. Voltage: 3V ~ 5V DC. Working Temperature: -30 c ~ 70 c. I2C/IIC Interface, need 2 IO only. Driver IC: SSD1306.

{"title": "WS2812B 4Pin SMD5050 RGB LED", "condition": "New", "description": "Description WS2813 (WS2812B) Introduction WS2813 is an upgraded version of the first generation of built-in driver IC-WS2812, in 2011 began research and development, in October 2012 officially put into the market. After the placement test during the IC crystal, crystal line link test, and fluorescent plastic anti giant cold test. . . It took almost a year. WS2812 IC products built at the beginning of the market, customers have been a little contradiction, because he is a new product is not easy to be accepted, but also because he really broke the conventional drive IC plus lamp beads concept. But look at today, almost all lighting manufacturers, application providers, decorative advertising works so accepted the built-in IC products, but also are keen on the production and use of the built-in IC products. The reason I believe we all know, because he really is more stable than the traditional, more concise, more beautiful, more performance, production and more convenient. WS2813 IC is built the second generation, even better than the first generation WS2812. It contains all the advantages of the first generation WS2812 WS2812 also better than all of the advantages. WS2813 is 4 pin 5050RGB lamp bead type. Pin fewer, more stable; lamp beads bracket brighter, better, higher brightness; circuit more compact, higher performance, production costs are lower; new positive and negative level reversal protection, not pick the wrong line It will burn. Features: The control circuit chip and RGB components in a package in 5050, to form a complete external control pixels. Built-in signal shaping circuit, any one pixel signal is received through the waveform shaping and then output to ensure line waveform distortion will not accumulate. Built-in power-on reset and brown-out reset circuit. Trichromatic color of each pixel of the display brightness can achieve 256, 16777216 colors to complete the full true color display, the scanning frequency of not less than 400Hz / s. Serial cascade interface, through a signal line to complete the receiving and decoding of data. Biography transmission distance between any two points in less than 5 meters without any additional circuitry. When the refresh rate of 30 frames / sec, the number of low-speed mode cascade of not less than 512 points, the high-speed mode is not less than 1024 points. Data transmission speeds of up to 800Kbps. Light color highly consistent, cost-effective. Application: LED full-color light-emitting character string lights, LED full-color module, LED full-color flexible light strip light bar, LED guardrail. LED spot light, LED pixel screen, LED shaped screen, a variety of electronic products, electrical equipment marquees. About WS2812: WS2812 is a set of control circuit and lighting circuit in one of the smart external control LED light source. Its shape and a same 5050LED lamp beads, each element is a pixel. Pixels contained within an intelligent digital interface data latch signal shaping amplification drive circuit further includes a high-precision internal oscillator and programmable 12V high voltage constant current control section, effectively ensuring the color pixel light highly consistent. NRZ data protocol uses a single line of communication, pixel after power-on reset, DIN end receives data transmitted from the controller, the first sent over 24bit pixel data is extracted first point, to the internal pixels data latch, the remaining data processing circuit through the internal plastic shaping amplified through the DO output port begins forwarding to the next cascade of pixels, each pixel through the transmission of a signal to reduce 24bit. Pixel using automatic shaping forwarding technology, so the number of pixels of the cascade unrestricted signal transmission, only limited by the signal transmission speed requirements. LED has a low voltage driving, high energy saving and environmental protection, brightness, scattering angle, consistency, and ultra-low-power, long life and other advantages. The control circuit is integrated in the LED above the circuit becomes more simple, small size, installation more convenient.", "url": "https://www.lankatronics.com/semiconductors/ws2812b-4pin-smd5050-rgb-led.html", "location": "online", "price": 30.0, "img": "None"},

{"title": "IR Break Beam Sensor - 5mm LEDs", "condition": "New", "description": "Infrared (IR) break-beam sensors are a simple way to detect motion. They work by having an emitter side that sends out a beam of human-invisible IR light, then a receiver across the way which is sensitive to that same light. When something passes between the two, and its not transparent to IR, then the 'beam is broken' and the receiver will let you know. Compared to PIR sensors, breakbeams are faster and allow better control of where you want to detect the motion. Compared to Sonar modules, they're less expensive. However, you do need both emitter and receiver on opposite sides of the area you want to monitor. This is the 5mm IR version. It works up to 50cm / 20\". You can power it from 3.3V or 5V, but 5V will get you better range and is what we suggest. The receiver is open collector transistor output which means that you do need a pull up resistor if you want to read a digital signal off the signal wire. Most microcontrollers have the ability to turn on a built in pull up resistor. If you do not, connect a 10K resistor between the white wire of the receiver and the red wire. If you want to control a relay or LED or whatever, it can sink up to 100mA to ground Technical Details Sensing Distance: Approx 50cm / 20\" Power Voltage: 3.3 - 5.5VDC Emitter Current Draw: 10mA @ 3.3V, 20mA @ 5V Output Current Capability of receiver: 100mA sink Transmitter/Receiver LED Angle: 10\u00b0 Response Time: <2 ms Dimensions: 20mm x 10mm x 8mm / 0.8\" x 0.4\" x 0.3\" Cable Length: 250mm / 10\" Weight (of each half): 3g", "url": "https://www.lankatronics.com/semiconductors/ir-break-beam-sensor-5mm-leds.html", "location": "online", "price": 650.0, "img": "None"},

It is the same material that professional PCB shops use.Contents include:30cm x 10cm Negative acting (Means UV exposed area of film will stay on board) photoresist sheet.How to use it:1. Prepare: Clean your board. Cut dry film a little larger than your board.2. Apply Resist: This Photoresist has 3 layers, the top and bottom layers are clear protective layer, so at the first, you need remove one protective layer, the easy way is to use two small pieces of scotch tape. Then apply the middle layer on board. A-- Apply using a hot roll laminator. This is the easiest and professional way to do it. B-- Apply using your hand. Starting from one corner and ending to the cross corner, use your palm to remove all air bubble between film and board, set the iron temperature about 130\u00b0C, apply the hot iron down onto the film and PCB, pressing them both flat and putting them under pressure.3. Expose: Place your negative artwork over the rest protective layer. Use a glass to press the artwork to the board snugly, then expose to UV light source or under sunlight, the source of light should be at least 8\" away from the artwork. The best exposure time is depends, but you can easy to recognize it: the color of film is changing from light blue to dark blue.4. Develop: Remember: you need NEGATIVE film developer, Remove the rest protective layer on the film, now only resist left on the board, develop board in developer solution that mixed by 1g developer powder with 100g(or 100ml) water (~1% by weight). After 3 minutes take board out of developer and hold under running water to check,you can always place it back in the developer if needs more time.5.

Hard crushing would cause damage and cracks in the magnetic material. Super strong magnets, please take care. Rare earth neodymium magnets, also known as NdFeB magnets or Neo magnets, are made from an alloy of neodymium, iron and boron. They have excellent magnetic property and are extremely strong for their small size. Neodymium magnets are permanent, and have a high maximum magnetic energy. Due to high ratio of performance over price, neodymium magnets has become extremely popular in almost all applications that require high performance magnets such as motors, sensors, computers, communications, medical equipment, meters, home appliances, craft model, jewelry and so on.

When placing magnets together, place a spacing material between them such as a piece of plastic, wood or cardboard so that they are easy to separate when needed. 7. Maintain a distance of at least 3 feet from other magnets or magnetically susceptible items when handling the magnets. Pay particular attention to scissors, knives, screw drivers or any other sharp metal objects. 8. To separate one magnet from the others, place them on a durable non-metal surface with the magnet-to-be-separated hanging off the edge of the table. Use one hand to firmly hold the other magnets on the table, especially those closest to the magnet being separated. Use the other hand to firmly hold the magnet you are separating. Push it down and away from the other magnets, until a magnetic attraction is no longer felt. Keep the separated magnets a safe distance from each other. Perfect for sticking notes on fridge doors.

{"title": "QTR-8RC Reflectance Sensor Array-POLOLU", "condition": "New", "description": "Functional Description The QTR-8RC reflectance sensor array is intended as a line sensor, but it can be used as a general-purpose proximity or reflectance sensor. The module is a convenient carrier for eight IR emitter and receiver (phototransistor) pairs evenly spaced at intervals of 0.375\" (9.525 mm). To use a sensor, you must first charge the output node by applying a voltage to its OUT pin. You can then read the reflectance by withdrawing the externally supplied voltage and timing how long it takes the output voltage to decay due to the integrated phototransistor. Shorter decay time is an indication of greater reflection. This measurement approach has several advantages, especially when coupled with the ability of the QTR-8RC module to turn off LED power: No analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is required Improved sensitivity over voltage-divider analog output Parallel reading of multiple sensors is possible with most microcontrollers Parallel reading allows optimized use of LED power enable option The outputs are all independent, but the LEDs are arranged in pairs to halve current consumption. The LEDs are controlled by a MOSFET with a gate normally pulled high, allowing the LEDs to be turned off by setting the MOSFET gate to a low voltage. Turning the LEDs off might be advantageous for limiting power consumption when the sensors are not in use or for varying the effective brightness of the LEDs through PWM control. This sensor was designed to be used with the board parallel to the surface being sensed. The LED current-limiting resistors for 5 V operation are arranged in two stages; this allows a simple bypass of one stage to enable operation at 3.3 V. The LED current is approximately 20\u201325 mA, making the total board consumption just under 100 mA. The schematic diagram of the module is shown below: For a similar array with three sensors, consider our QTR-3RC reflectance sensor array. The sensors on the QTR-8RC are also available individually as the QTR-1RC reflectance sensor, and the QTR-L-1RC is an alternative designed to be used with the board perpendicular to the surface. QTR sensor size comparison. Clockwise from top left: QTR-3RC, QTR-1RC, QTR-L-1RC, QTR-8RC. Specifications Dimensions: 2.95\" x 0.5\" x 0.125\" (without header pins installed) Operating voltage: 3.3-5.0 V Supply current: 100 mA Output format: 8 digital I/O-compatible signals that can be read as a timed high pulse Optimal sensing distance: 0.125\" (3 mm) Maximum recommended sensing distance: 0.375\" (9.5 mm) Weight without header pins: 0.11 oz (3.09 g) QTR-1RC output (yellow) when 1/8\" above a black line and microcontroller timing of that output (blue). Interfacing the QTR-8RC Outputs to Digital I/O Lines The QTR-8RC module has eight identical sensor outputs that, like the Parallax QTI, require a digital I/O line capable of driving the output line high and then measuring the time for the output voltage to decay. The typical sequence for reading a sensor is: Turn on IR LEDs (optional). Set the I/O line to an output and drive it high. Allow at least 10 \u03bcs for the sensor output to rise. Make the I/O line an input (high impedance). Measure the time for the voltage to decay by waiting for the I/O line to go low. Turn off IR LEDs (optional). These steps can typically be executed in parallel on multiple I/O lines. With a strong reflectance, the decay time can be as low as several dozen microseconds; with no reflectance, the decay time can be up to a few milliseconds. The exact time of the decay depends on your microcontroller\u2019s I/O line characteristics. Meaningful results can be available within 1 ms in typical cases (i.e. when not trying to measure subtle differences in low-reflectance scenarios), allowing up to 1 kHz sampling of all 8 sensors. If lower-frequency sampling is sufficient, substantial power savings can be realized by turning off the LEDs. For example, if a 100 Hz sampling rate is acceptable, the LEDs can be off 90% of the time, lowering average current consumption from 100 mA to 10 mA. Our Pololu AVR library provides functions that make it easy to use these sensors with our Orangutan robot controllers; please see the QTR Reflectance Sensors section of our library command reference for more information. We also have a Arduino library for these sensors. Breaking the Module in Two If you don\u2019t need or cannot fit all eight sensors, you can break off two sensors and still use all 8 sensors as two separate modules, as shown below. The PCB can be scored from both sides along the perforation and then bent until it snaps apart. Each of the two resulting pieces will function as an independent line sensor. Included Components This module ships with a 25-pin 0.1\" header strip and a 100 Ohm through-hole resistor as shown below. You can break the header strip into smaller pieces and solder them onto your reflectance sensor array as desired, or you can solder wires directly to the unit or use a right-angle header strip for a more compact installation. The pins on the module are arranged so that they can all be accessed using either an 11\u00d71 strip or an 8\u00d72 strip. The resistor is required to make the two-sensor array functional after the original eight-sensor array is broken into two pieces. This resistor is only needed once the board has been broken. Solder the included resistor to the 2-sensor array piece as shown to make the separated piece functional.", "url": "https://www.lankatronics.com/robot-accessories/qtr-8rc-reflectance-sensor-array.html", "location": "online", "price": 2350.0, "img": "None"},
{"title": "QTR-8A Reflectance Sensor Array-POLOLU", "condition": "New", "description": "Functional Description The QTR-8A reflectance sensor array is intended as a line sensor, but it can be used as a general-purpose proximity or reflectance sensor. The module is a convenient carrier for eight IR emitter and receiver (phototransistor) pairs evenly spaced at intervals of 0.375\" (9.525 mm). Each phototransistor is connected to a pull-up resistor to form a voltage divider that produces an analog voltage output between 0 V and VIN (which is typically 5 V) as a function of the reflected IR. Lower output voltage is an indication of greater reflection. The outputs are all independent, but the LEDs are arranged in pairs to halve current consumption. The LEDs are controlled by a MOSFET with a gate normally pulled high, allowing the LEDs to be turned off by setting the MOSFET gate to a low voltage. Turning the LEDs off might be advantageous for limiting power consumption when the sensors are not in use or for varying the effective brightness of the LEDs through PWM control. The LED current-limiting resistors for 5 V operation are arranged in two stages; this allows a simple bypass of one stage to enable operation at 3.3 V. The LED current is approximately 20-25 mA, making the total board consumption just under 100 mA. The schematic diagram of the module is shown below: For a similar array with three sensors, consider our QTR-3A reflectance sensor array. The sensors on the QTR-8A are also available individually as the QTR-1A reflectance sensor, and the QTR-L-1A is an alternative designed to be used with the board perpendicular to the surface. QTR sensor size comparison. Clockwise from top left: QTR-3RC, QTR-1RC, QTR-L-1RC, QTR-8RC. Specifications Dimensions: 2.95\" x 0.5\" x 0.125\" (without header pins installed) Operating voltage: 3.3-5.0 V Supply current: 100 mA Output format: 8 analog voltages Output voltage range: 0 V to supplied voltage Optimal sensing distance: 0.125\" (3 mm) Maximum recommended sensing distance: 0.25\" (6 mm) Weight without header pins: 0.11 oz (3.09 g) Interfacing with the QTR-8A Outputs There are several ways you can interface with the QTR-8A outputs: Use a microcontroller\u2019s analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to measure the voltages. Use a comparator with an adjustable threshold to convert each analog voltage into a digital (i.e. black/white) signal that can be read by the digital I/O line of a microcontroller. Connect each output directly to a digital I/O line of a microcontroller and rely upon its internal comparator. This last method will work if you are able to get high reflectance from your white surface as depicted in the left image, but will probably fail if you have a lower-reflectance signal profile like the one on the right. QTR-1A output 1/8\" away from a spinning white disk with a black line on it. QTR-1A output 3/8\" away from a spinning white disk with a black line on it. Our Pololu AVR library provides functions that make it easy to use these sensors with our Orangutan robot controllers; please see the QTR Reflectance Sensors section of our library command reference for more information.

The v2 camera has a Sony IMX219 8-megapixel sensor (compared to the 5-megapixel OmniVision OV5647 sensor of the original camera). The Pi NoIR gives you everything the regular camera module offers, with one difference: it does not employ an infrared filter. (NoIR = No Infrared.) This means that pictures you take by daylight will look decidedly curious, but it gives you the ability to see in the dark with infrared lighting. We bundle a little square of blue gel with the Pi NoIR, which you can use with the Pi NoIR to monitor the health of green plants. The Pi NoIR is very popular among wildlife hobbyists: with a few infra-red LEDs, you can monitor what nocturnal animals are doing in your garden without disturbing them. The camera works with all models of Raspberry Pi 1, 2 and 3. It can be accessed through the MMAL and V4L APIs, and there are numerous third-party libraries built for it, including the Picamera Python library.

This is the series 2 ZigBee protocol 1mW with wire antenna. Its good for point-to-point, multipoint and mesh networks. This module is a little more difficult to get going than the Series 1 - you must set up a \"coordinator\" module so they are not as plug-and-play. Series 2 modules cannot talk to Series 1 modules so if you already have some S1 type XBees you may want to stick with them. The S2 modules are not necessarily 'better' than S1 for many projects. They're just different as they use the \"ZigBee\" wireless stack instead of the 802.15.4. This makes them better for low power usage and advanced users who want a mesh topology (many XBees in a spread-out configuration) - but they are more difficult to use for basic point-to-point setups. The pins on an XBee are 2mm spacing, not 0.1\" so they will not fit into a breadboard.

We also added a slot so that you can connect a 26-pin IDC cable to the GPIO breakout pins on the Pi and pass it though the case. For more advanced hacking, the enclosure is designed so that you can remove the top piece and plug any sort of cables you wish into the breakouts in the middle. The case is airy enough that no additional vents or cooling is required - we tested the enclosed Pi over a 24 hour period at full load with no significant increase in temperature.", "url": "https://www.lankatronics.com/top-brands/enclosure-for-raspberry-pi-model-a-or-b.html", "location": "online", "price": 650.0, "img": "None"},

This is the PRO Series 2 ZigBee protocol 63mW with wire antenna. Its good for point-to-point, multipoint and mesh networks. This module is a little more difficult to get going than the Series 1 - you must set up a \"coordinator\" module so they are not as plug-and-play. Series 2 modules cannot talk to Series 1 modules so if you already have some S1 type XBees you may want to stick with them. The S2 modules are not necessarily 'better' than S1 for many projects. They're just different as they use the \"ZigBee\" wireless stack instead of the 802.15.4. This makes them better for low power usage and advanced users who want a mesh topology (many XBees in a spread-out configuration) - but they are more difficult to use for basic point-to-point setups. The pins on an XBee are 2mm spacing, not 0.1\" so they will not fit into a breadboard. For that reason, they work best in our XBee adapter module kit (which has a 250mA 3.3V regulator) or with the USB XBee adapter.

At the Feather 32u4's heart is at ATmega32u4 clocked at 8 MHz and at 3.3V logic, a chip setup we've had tons of experience with as it's the same as the Flora. This chip has 32K of flash and 2K of RAM, with built in USB so not only does it have a USB-to-Serial program & debug capability built in with no need for an FTDI-like chip, it can also act like a mouse, keyboard, USB MIDI device, etc. This chip is well supported in the Arduino IDE and can run just about every sensor/library out there. To make it easy to use for portable projects, we added a connector for any of our 3.7V Lithium polymer batteries and built in battery charging. You don't need a battery, it will run just fine straight from the micro USB connector. But, if you do have a battery, you can take it on the go, then plug in the USB to recharge. The Feather will automatically switch over to USB power when its available. We also tied the battery thru a divider to an analog pin, so you can measure and monitor the battery voltage to detect when you need a recharge. Here's some handy specs!

{"title": "QTR-8A Reflectance Sensor Array-POLOLU", "condition": "New", "description": "Functional Description The QTR-8A reflectance sensor array is intended as a line sensor, but it can be used as a general-purpose proximity or reflectance sensor. The module is a convenient carrier for eight IR emitter and receiver (phototransistor) pairs evenly spaced at intervals of 0.375\" (9.525 mm). Each phototransistor is connected to a pull-up resistor to form a voltage divider that produces an analog voltage output between 0 V and VIN (which is typically 5 V) as a function of the reflected IR. Lower output voltage is an indication of greater reflection. The outputs are all independent, but the LEDs are arranged in pairs to halve current consumption. The LEDs are controlled by a MOSFET with a gate normally pulled high, allowing the LEDs to be turned off by setting the MOSFET gate to a low voltage. Turning the LEDs off might be advantageous for limiting power consumption when the sensors are not in use or for varying the effective brightness of the LEDs through PWM control. The LED current-limiting resistors for 5 V operation are arranged in two stages; this allows a simple bypass of one stage to enable operation at 3.3 V. The LED current is approximately 20-25 mA, making the total board consumption just under 100 mA. The schematic diagram of the module is shown below: For a similar array with three sensors, consider our QTR-3A reflectance sensor array. The sensors on the QTR-8A are also available individually as the QTR-1A reflectance sensor, and the QTR-L-1A is an alternative designed to be used with the board perpendicular to the surface. QTR sensor size comparison. Clockwise from top left: QTR-3RC, QTR-1RC, QTR-L-1RC, QTR-8RC. Specifications Dimensions: 2.95\" x 0.5\" x 0.125\" (without header pins installed) Operating voltage: 3.3-5.0 V Supply current: 100 mA Output format: 8 analog voltages Output voltage range: 0 V to supplied voltage Optimal sensing distance: 0.125\" (3 mm) Maximum recommended sensing distance: 0.25\" (6 mm) Weight without header pins: 0.11 oz (3.09 g) Interfacing with the QTR-8A Outputs There are several ways you can interface with the QTR-8A outputs: Use a microcontroller\u2019s analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to measure the voltages. Use a comparator with an adjustable threshold to convert each analog voltage into a digital (i.e. black/white) signal that can be read by the digital I/O line of a microcontroller. Connect each output directly to a digital I/O line of a microcontroller and rely upon its internal comparator. This last method will work if you are able to get high reflectance from your white surface as depicted in the left image, but will probably fail if you have a lower-reflectance signal profile like the one on the right. QTR-1A output 1/8\" away from a spinning white disk with a black line on it. QTR-1A output 3/8\" away from a spinning white disk with a black line on it. Our Pololu AVR library provides functions that make it easy to use these sensors with our Orangutan robot controllers; please see the QTR Reflectance Sensors section of our library command reference for more information. We also have a Arduino library for these sensors. Breaking the Module in Two If you don\u2019t need or cannot fit all eight sensors, you can break off two sensors and still use all 8 sensors as two separate modules, as shown below. The PCB can be scored from both sides along the perforation and then bent until it snaps apart. Each of the two resulting pieces will function as an independent line sensor. Included Components This module ships with a 25-pin 0.1\" header strip and a 100 Ohm through-hole resistor as shown below. You can break the header strip into smaller pieces and solder them onto your reflectance sensor array as desired, or you can solder wires directly to the unit or use a right-angle header strip for a more compact installation. The pins on the module are arranged so that they can all be accessed using either an 11\u00d71 strip or an 8\u00d72 strip. The resistor is required to make the two-sensor array functional after the original eight-sensor array is broken into two pieces. This resistor is only needed once the board has been broken. Solder the included resistor to the 2-sensor array piece as shown to make the separated piece functional.", "url": "https://www.lankatronics.com/top-brands/qtr-8a-reflectance-sensor-array-pololu.html", "location": "online", "price": 2350.0, "img": "None"},

The module is a convenient carrier for three IR emitter and receiver (phototransistor) pairs. With sensors spaced at intervals of 0.375\u2032\u2032 (9.525 mm) along of the board\u2019s longer axis, this array works well as a minimal detector for line-following robots, as line-following courses are commonly made using 3/4\u2032\u2032 (19 mm) black electrical tape. The middle sensor is slightly offset along the short axis of the board. To use a sensor, you must first charge the output node by applying a voltage to its OUT pin. You can then read the reflectance by withdrawing the externally supplied voltage and timing how long it takes the output voltage to decay due to the integrated phototransistor. Shorter decay time is an indication of greater reflection. This measurement approach has several advantages, especially when multiple units are used: No analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is required Improved sensitivity over voltage-divider analog output Parallel reading of multiple sensors is possible with most microcontrollers The LED current-limiting resistors are set to deliver approximately 17 mA to the LEDs when VCC is 5 V, making the total board consumption just over 50 mA. The schematic diagram of the module is shown below: This schematic is also available as a downloadable pdf (117k pdf). For an alternative array with eight sensors and the ability to turn off the IR LEDs to limit power consumption, consider our QTR-8RC reflectance sensor array.

The typical sequence for reading a sensor is: Set the I/O line to an output and drive it high. Wait several microseconds to give the 2.2 nF capacitor node time to reach 5 V. Make the I/O line an input (high impedance). Measure the time for the capacitor node voltage to decay by waiting for the I/O line to go low. These steps can typically be executed in parallel on multiple I/O lines. With a strong reflectance, the decay time can be as low as several dozen microseconds; with no reflectance, the decay time can be up to a few milliseconds. The exact time of the decay depends on your microcontroller\u2019s I/O line characteristics. Meaningful results can be available within 1 ms in typical cases (i.e. when not trying to measure subtle differences in low-reflectance scenarios), allowing up to 1 kHz sampling of all three sensors.

Get Started 1.8G (or bigger) TF card( Speed class is recommended for Class 6 or higher) 2.TF card reader 3.Debian for pcDuino4 nano 4.Windows tool: Win32DiskImager 1. Make a Bootable SD Card Plug TF Card Reader into Windows PC and open Win32DiskImager as administrator. Select the Image File that you unzip from the downloaded File Select the Device that the PC recognized Click the write button. It will say Write Successful at the end. Tips: If you only have Linux or Mac OS, how to create a bootable SD card? Only dd command is needed. sudo dd if=<image-file>.img of=/dev/<your SD card disk> bs=1M if=should be your downloaded system img file of=should be your micro-SD card. 2. Boot your system Insert this card into your pcDuino4 nano\u2019s BOOT slot Power on (with a 5V\\/2A power source). If the green LED is on and the blue LED is blinking this indicates your pcDuino4 nano has successfully booted. Note: The default of username and password are all: ls 3. Remove Desktop Access via VNC If you want to access the Debian system using VNC, please take the following information: Default Port : 5901 Password: ls123456 Tips 1. Extend TF Card\u2019s rootfs Section Resize the rootfs section of the TF card run the following commands on the pcDuino4 Nano\u2019s Debian terminal: sudo fs_resize Following the prompt type in \u201cy\u201d to start re-sizing the file system and a second \u201cy\u201d to reboot the pcDuino4 Nano. 2. Ethernet Connection If the pcDuino4 Nano is connected to a network via Ethernet before it is powered on it will automatically obtain an IP after it is powered up. If it is not connected via Ethernet or its DHCP is not activated obtaining an IP will fail and system will hang on for about 15 to 60 seconds The pcDuino4 Nano by default doesn\u2019t have a valid MAC address. If the board connects a network successfully it will automatically generates a random MAC in /etc/network/interfaces.d/eth0 Users can change it to a self-defined valid one:vi \\/etc\\/network\\/interfaces.d\\/eth0 Here is the content of a sample configuration file: auto eth0 allow-hotplug eth0 iface eth0 inet dhcp hwaddress 76:92:d4:85:f3:0f The hwaddress specifies the MAC address. Here the 76:92:d4:85:f3:0f is a random MAC. We suggest users change it to a valid one. Note: when you reset the MAC please make sure your MAC meets IEEE\u2019s definition otherwise it will cause unexpected issues. After you make your change, save, exit and reboot your board or run the following commands to restart the network: systemctl restart networking 3. HDMI resolution Our Debian system\u2019s HDMI resolution is set by a script.bin file in the root directory of the installation TF card\u2019s boot section. By default the resolution is 1080P60. There are multiple script.bin files under that directory for different resolutions. For example if you want to modify the resolution to 720P60 you can use the script-720p-60.bin file to replace the existing one by using the following command: # in TF card boot partition sudo cp script/script-720p-60.bin ./script.bin 4. HDMI Audio Output Our Debian system\u2019s default audio output is the 3.5mm audio jack. You can turn on the HDMI audio by editting the \\/etc\\/asound.conf file: pcm.!default { type hw card 1 device 0 } ctl.!default { type hw card 1 } card 0 points to the 3.5mm audio jack and card 1 points to the HDMI audio. You need to save your changes and reboot your system to make your changes take effect. 5. Test GPU After Debian loads please login from a terminal and run glmark2-es2: glmark2-e 6. USB WiFi Our Debian system has support for popular USB WiFi drivers. Many USB WiFi modules are plug and play with our system. Here is a list of models we tested; If you pcDuino4 Nano is connected to a USB WiFi and is powered up you can log into pcDuino4 Nano and run the following command to check if the USB WiFi is recognized. If \u201cwlan0\u201d is listed it indicates your USB WiFi has been recognized: ifconfig -a Open the \\/etc\\/wpa_supplicant\\/wpa_supplicant.conf file and append the following lines: network={ ssid=\"YourWiFiESSID\" psk=\"YourWiFiPassword\" } The YourWiFiESSID and YourWiFiPassword need to be replaced with your actual SSID and password. Save, exit and run the following commands to connect to your WiFi router: ifdown wlan0 ifup wlan0 If your WiFi password has special characters or you don\u2019t want your password saved as plain text you can use \u201cwpa_passphrase\u201d to generate a psk for your WiFi password.
