The module is a convenient carrier for three IR emitter and receiver (phototransistor) pairs. With sensors spaced at intervals of 0.375\u2032\u2032 (9.525 mm) along of the board\u2019s longer axis, this array works well as a minimal detector for line-following robots, as line-following courses are commonly made using 3/4\u2032\u2032 (19 mm) black electrical tape. The middle sensor is slightly offset along the short axis of the board. Each phototransistor is connected to a pull-up resistor to form a voltage divider that produces an analog voltage output between 0 V and VCC (which is typically 5 V) as a function of the reflected IR. Lower output voltage is an indication of greater reflection. The LED current-limiting resistors are set to deliver approximately 17 mA to the LEDs when VCC is 5 V, making the total board consumption just over 50 mA. The schematic diagram of the module is shown below: This schematic is also available as a downloadable pdf (115k pdf). For an alternative array with eight sensors and the ability to turn off the IR LEDs to limit power consumption, consider our QTR-8A reflectance sensor array.

Use a comparator with an adjustable threshold to convert each analog voltage into a digital (i.e. black/white) signal that can be read by the digital I/O line of a microcontroller. Connect each output directly to a digital I/O line of a microcontroller and rely upon its internal comparator.

{"location": "online", "price": 2350.0, "description": "Functional Description The QTR-8RC reflectance sensor array is intended as a line sensor, but it can be used as a general-purpose proximity or reflectance sensor. The module is a convenient carrier for eight IR emitter and receiver (phototransistor) pairs evenly spaced at intervals of 0.375\" (9.525 mm). To use a sensor, you must first charge the output node by applying a voltage to its OUT pin. You can then read the reflectance by withdrawing the externally supplied voltage and timing how long it takes the output voltage to decay due to the integrated phototransistor. Shorter decay time is an indication of greater reflection. This measurement approach has several advantages, especially when coupled with the ability of the QTR-8RC module to turn off LED power: No analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is required Improved sensitivity over voltage-divider analog output Parallel reading of multiple sensors is possible with most microcontrollers Parallel reading allows optimized use of LED power enable option The outputs are all independent, but the LEDs are arranged in pairs to halve current consumption. The LEDs are controlled by a MOSFET with a gate normally pulled high, allowing the LEDs to be turned off by setting the MOSFET gate to a low voltage. Turning the LEDs off might be advantageous for limiting power consumption when the sensors are not in use or for varying the effective brightness of the LEDs through PWM control. This sensor was designed to be used with the board parallel to the surface being sensed. The LED current-limiting resistors for 5 V operation are arranged in two stages; this allows a simple bypass of one stage to enable operation at 3.3 V. The LED current is approximately 20\u201325 mA, making the total board consumption just under 100 mA. The schematic diagram of the module is shown below: For a similar array with three sensors, consider our QTR-3RC reflectance sensor array. The sensors on the QTR-8RC are also available individually as the QTR-1RC reflectance sensor, and the QTR-L-1RC is an alternative designed to be used with the board perpendicular to the surface. QTR sensor size comparison. Clockwise from top left: QTR-3RC, QTR-1RC, QTR-L-1RC, QTR-8RC. Specifications Dimensions: 2.95\" x 0.5\" x 0.125\" (without header pins installed) Operating voltage: 3.3-5.0 V Supply current: 100 mA Output format: 8 digital I/O-compatible signals that can be read as a timed high pulse Optimal sensing distance: 0.125\" (3 mm) Maximum recommended sensing distance: 0.375\" (9.5 mm) Weight without header pins: 0.11 oz (3.09 g) QTR-1RC output (yellow) when 1/8\" above a black line and microcontroller timing of that output (blue). Interfacing the QTR-8RC Outputs to Digital I/O Lines The QTR-8RC module has eight identical sensor outputs that, like the Parallax QTI, require a digital I/O line capable of driving the output line high and then measuring the time for the output voltage to decay. The typical sequence for reading a sensor is: Turn on IR LEDs (optional). Set the I/O line to an output and drive it high. Allow at least 10 \u03bcs for the sensor output to rise. Make the I/O line an input (high impedance). Measure the time for the voltage to decay by waiting for the I/O line to go low. Turn off IR LEDs (optional). These steps can typically be executed in parallel on multiple I/O lines. With a strong reflectance, the decay time can be as low as several dozen microseconds; with no reflectance, the decay time can be up to a few milliseconds. The exact time of the decay depends on your microcontroller\u2019s I/O line characteristics. Meaningful results can be available within 1 ms in typical cases (i.e. when not trying to measure subtle differences in low-reflectance scenarios), allowing up to 1 kHz sampling of all 8 sensors. If lower-frequency sampling is sufficient, substantial power savings can be realized by turning off the LEDs. For example, if a 100 Hz sampling rate is acceptable, the LEDs can be off 90% of the time, lowering average current consumption from 100 mA to 10 mA. Our Pololu AVR library provides functions that make it easy to use these sensors with our Orangutan robot controllers; please see the QTR Reflectance Sensors section of our library command reference for more information. We also have a Arduino library for these sensors. Breaking the Module in Two If you don\u2019t need or cannot fit all eight sensors, you can break off two sensors and still use all 8 sensors as two separate modules, as shown below.

For individual reflectance sensors, consider our QTR-1RC and QTR-L-1RC. QTR sensor size comparison. Clockwise from top left: QTR-3RC, QTR-1RC, QTR-L-1RC, QTR-8RC. Specifications Dimensions: 1.25\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 0.3\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 0.1\u2032\u2032 (32 mm \u00d7 8 mm \u00d7 3 mm) (without header pins installed) Operating voltage: 5.0 V Supply current: 50 mA Output format: 3 digital I/O-compatible signals that can be read as a timed high pulse Optimal sensing distance: 0.125\" (3 mm) Maximum recommended sensing distance: 0.25\" (6 mm) Weight without header pins: 0.02 oz (0.6 g) Interfacing the QTR-3RC Outputs to Digital I/O Lines The QTR-3RC module has three identical sensor outputs that, like the Parallax QTI, require a digital I/O line capable of driving the output line high and then measuring the time for the output voltage to decay. The typical sequence for reading a sensor is: Set the I/O line to an output and drive it high. Wait several microseconds to give the 2.2 nF capacitor node time to reach 5 V. Make the I/O line an input (high impedance). Measure the time for the capacitor node voltage to decay by waiting for the I/O line to go low. These steps can typically be executed in parallel on multiple I/O lines. With a strong reflectance, the decay time can be as low as several dozen microseconds; with no reflectance, the decay time can be up to a few milliseconds. The exact time of the decay depends on your microcontroller\u2019s I/O line characteristics. Meaningful results can be available within 1 ms in typical cases (i.e. when not trying to measure subtle differences in low-reflectance scenarios), allowing up to 1 kHz sampling of all three sensors. Our Pololu AVR library provides functions that make it easy to use these sensors with our Orangutan robot controllers; please see the QTR Reflectance Sensors section of our library command reference for more information. We also have a Arduino library for these sensors. Included Components This module has two mounting holes intended for #2 screws (not included); if the mounting holes are not needed, the ends of the PCB can be ground off to make the unit even smaller (less than 1\u2032\u2032 wide). The reflectance sensor array ships with a 1\u00d75 straight male header strip and a1\u00d75 right-angle male header strip as shown below. You can also solder wires, such as ribbon cable, directly to the pads for the smallest installation. QTR-3A or QTR-3RC reflectance sensor array with included header pins.

Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or can be connected to software on your computer (e.g. Flash, Processing, MaxMSP). The open-source IDE can be downloaded for free (currently for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux). The Leonardo is Arduino's first development board to use one microcontroller with built-in USB. Using the ATmega32U4 as its sole microcontroller allows it to be cheaper and simpler. Also, because the 32U4 is handling the USB directly, code libraries are available which allow the board to emulate a computer keyboard, mouse, and more using the USB-HID protocol! It has 20 digital input/output pins (of which 7 can be used as PWM outputs and 12 as analog inputs), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a micro USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button.

The ADC Differential Pi is based on two Microchip MCP3424 A/D converters each containing 4 analogue inputs. The MCP3424 is a delta-sigma A/D converter with low noise differential inputs. Not sure which ADC you need ? Check our Analogue to Digital Buyers guide to compare our ADC expansion boards. We designed the ADC Differential Pi as a companion for our ADC Pi. Unlike the ADC Pi the ADC Differential Pi does not include any voltage dividers so the inputs can be used to measure a differential voltage range of \u00b12.048V. This is useful for measuring inputs below \u00b12.048V or allows you to use your own voltage divider to measure higher voltages. The ADC Differential Pi is powered through the host Raspberry Pi using the GPIO port and extended pins on the GPIO connector allow you to stack the ADC Differential Pi along with other expansion boards. The two MCP3424 A/D converters communicate via i2c to the host Raspberry Pi giving you eight analogue inputs to use. A logic level converter is included on the ADC Pi Plus board giving you a buffered 5V i2c port making it easy to add other I2C devices which operate at 5 volts without damaging the raspberry pi 3.3 volt i2c port. The i2c buffer uses N-channel mosfets with a maximum drain current of 100mA. The I2C address bits are selectable using the on-board jumpers. The MCP3424 supports up to 8 different I2C addresses so with two A/D converters on each ADC Differential Pi you can stack up to 4 ADC Differential Pi boards on a single Raspberry Pi giving you 32 ADC inputs. The MCP3424 contains an on-board 2.048V reference voltage with an input range of \u00b12.048V differentially (full scale range of 4.096V/PGA). A programmable Gain Amplifier gives the user a selectable gain of x1, x2, x4 or x8 before the analogue to digital conversion takes place. The data rate for analogue to digital conversions is 3.75 (18 bit), 15 (16 bit), 60 (14 bit) or 240 (12 bit) samples per second. Data rate and resolution can be configured within software using the I2C interface. We have a knowledge base article, ADC Sample Rate Comparison which has more detailed sample information and test scripts to compare the different MCP2424 ADC chip bit and sample rates. Unused inputs should be tied to ground. Legacy Delta Sigma Pi Versions See our KB article for previous versions of this board.

Mechanical Drawings Click image to enlarge Assembly The ADC Differential Pi is supplied with the 40 pin GPIO connector and the 12 pin address connector unsoldered. Before using the ADC Differential Pi you will need to solder both connectors onto the PCB. We suggest soldering the 40 pin GPIO connector first and then the address select connector. Soldering the address select connector first will make it difficult to access the three corner pins on the GPIO connector. Assembly for the ADC Differential Pi is the same as on our ADC Pi Plus. PCB Header Assembly Jig Download and print our PCB Header Assembly Jig to hold your circuit board when soldering the header pins. I2C Address Selection The MCP3424 analogue to digital converter contains two address select pins which can be tied to Vss, Vdd or left floating. This gives 8 possible I2C addresses for each chip. The ADC Differential Pi contains two MCP3424 chips so you can stack up to 4 ADC Differential Pi boards on a single Raspberry Pi. To simplify address selection on the ADC Differential Pi we have included a set of address selection pins which can be configured using the included jumpers. The illustrations below show the four recommended configurations for your ADC Differential Pi and the associated I2C addresses. Note:Disconnect the ADC Differential Pi from the Raspberry Pi before changing the address pins. You may need to short the 5V and ground with a resistor to discharge the capacitors in order for the new addresses to be recognised. Warning Do not under any circumstanced connect the two centre pins together. This will create a direct short between the 5V and ground pins and will damage or destroy your Raspberry Pi and ADC Pi Plus board.

{"location": "online", "price": 850.0, "description": "What is OLED? OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode) is a self light-emitting technology composed of a thin, multi-layered organic film placed between an anode and cathode. In contrast to LCD technology, OLED does not require a backlight. OLED possesses high application potential for virtually all types of displays and is regarded as the ultimate technology for the next generation of flat-panel displays. The use of OLED technology offers the following advantages for flat-panel displays? 1. A simplified manufacturing process compared to TFT-LCD . 2. Self-emitting light, in contrast to the required backlight for TFT-LCD. 3. High luminosity. 4. Lightweight and thin (less than 2 mm). 5. Capable of wide viewing angles?~180?? 6. Low operating voltage and power consumption. 7. Quick response (~ ? second level). 8. Wide range of operating temperatures (-40c to 85c). A Comparison of OLED and TFT-LCD Display Technologies How Does OLED Emit Light? OLED\"s basic structure consists of organic materials positioned between the cathode and the anode, which is composed of electric conductive transparent Indium Tin Oxide (ITO). The organic materials compose a multi-layered thin film, which includes the Hole Transporting Layer (HTL), Emission Layer (EML) and the Electron Transporting Layer (ETL). By applying the appropriate electric voltage, holes and electrons are injected into the EML from the anode and the cathode, respectively. The holes and electrons combine inside the EML to form excitons, after which electroluminescence occurs. The transfer material, emission layer material and choice of electrode are the key factors that determine the quality of OLED components. Features: Needn't backlight, the display unit can self-luminous. High resolution: 128 * 64. Viewing angle:> 160 . Supports many control chip: Fully compatible with Arduino, 51 Series, MSP430 Series, STM32 / 2, CSR IC, etc. Ultra-low power consumption: full screen lit 0.08W. Voltage: 3V ~ 5V DC.

{"location": "online", "price": 650.0, "description": "Infrared (IR) break-beam sensors are a simple way to detect motion. They work by having an emitter side that sends out a beam of human-invisible IR light, then a receiver across the way which is sensitive to that same light. When something passes between the two, and its not transparent to IR, then the 'beam is broken' and the receiver will let you know. Compared to PIR sensors, breakbeams are faster and allow better control of where you want to detect the motion. Compared to Sonar modules, they're less expensive. However, you do need both emitter and receiver on opposite sides of the area you want to monitor. This is the 5mm IR version. It works up to 50cm / 20\". You can power it from 3.3V or 5V, but 5V will get you better range and is what we suggest. The receiver is open collector transistor output which means that you do need a pull up resistor if you want to read a digital signal off the signal wire. Most microcontrollers have the ability to turn on a built in pull up resistor. If you do not, connect a 10K resistor between the white wire of the receiver and the red wire. If you want to control a relay or LED or whatever, it can sink up to 100mA to ground Technical Details Sensing Distance: Approx 50cm / 20\" Power Voltage: 3.3 - 5.5VDC Emitter Current Draw: 10mA @ 3.3V, 20mA @ 5V Output Current Capability of receiver: 100mA sink Transmitter/Receiver LED Angle: 10\u00b0 Response Time: <2 ms Dimensions: 20mm x 10mm x 8mm / 0.8\" x 0.4\" x 0.3\" Cable Length: 250mm / 10\" Weight (of each half): 3g", "title": "IR Break Beam Sensor - 5mm LEDs", "url": "https://www.lankatronics.com/semiconductors/ir-break-beam-sensor-5mm-leds.html", "store": "Lankatronics", "img": "None", "condition": "New"},

After the placement test during the IC crystal, crystal line link test, and fluorescent plastic anti giant cold test. . . It took almost a year. WS2812 IC products built at the beginning of the market, customers have been a little contradiction, because he is a new product is not easy to be accepted, but also because he really broke the conventional drive IC plus lamp beads concept. But look at today, almost all lighting manufacturers, application providers, decorative advertising works so accepted the built-in IC products, but also are keen on the production and use of the built-in IC products. The reason I believe we all know, because he really is more stable than the traditional, more concise, more beautiful, more performance, production and more convenient. WS2813 IC is built the second generation, even better than the first generation WS2812. It contains all the advantages of the first generation WS2812 WS2812 also better than all of the advantages. WS2813 is 4 pin 5050RGB lamp bead type. Pin fewer, more stable; lamp beads bracket brighter, better, higher brightness; circuit more compact, higher performance, production costs are lower; new positive and negative level reversal protection, not pick the wrong line It will burn. Features: The control circuit chip and RGB components in a package in 5050, to form a complete external control pixels. Built-in signal shaping circuit, any one pixel signal is received through the waveform shaping and then output to ensure line waveform distortion will not accumulate. Built-in power-on reset and brown-out reset circuit. Trichromatic color of each pixel of the display brightness can achieve 256, 16777216 colors to complete the full true color display, the scanning frequency of not less than 400Hz / s. Serial cascade interface, through a signal line to complete the receiving and decoding of data. Biography transmission distance between any two points in less than 5 meters without any additional circuitry. When the refresh rate of 30 frames / sec, the number of low-speed mode cascade of not less than 512 points, the high-speed mode is not less than 1024 points. Data transmission speeds of up to 800Kbps. Light color highly consistent, cost-effective.

About WS2812: WS2812 is a set of control circuit and lighting circuit in one of the smart external control LED light source. Its shape and a same 5050LED lamp beads, each element is a pixel. Pixels contained within an intelligent digital interface data latch signal shaping amplification drive circuit further includes a high-precision internal oscillator and programmable 12V high voltage constant current control section, effectively ensuring the color pixel light highly consistent. NRZ data protocol uses a single line of communication, pixel after power-on reset, DIN end receives data transmitted from the controller, the first sent over 24bit pixel data is extracted first point, to the internal pixels data latch, the remaining data processing circuit through the internal plastic shaping amplified through the DO output port begins forwarding to the next cascade of pixels, each pixel through the transmission of a signal to reduce 24bit. Pixel using automatic shaping forwarding technology, so the number of pixels of the cascade unrestricted signal transmission, only limited by the signal transmission speed requirements. LED has a low voltage driving, high energy saving and environmental protection, brightness, scattering angle, consistency, and ultra-low-power, long life and other advantages.

If the resist does not fully remove from the exposed areas, the UV received was insufficient.

It is the same material that professional PCB shops use.Contents include:30cm x 10cm Negative acting (Means UV exposed area of film will stay on board) photoresist sheet.How to use it:1. Prepare: Clean your board. Cut dry film a little larger than your board.2. Apply Resist: This Photoresist has 3 layers, the top and bottom layers are clear protective layer, so at the first, you need remove one protective layer, the easy way is to use two small pieces of scotch tape. Then apply the middle layer on board. A-- Apply using a hot roll laminator. This is the easiest and professional way to do it. B-- Apply using your hand. Starting from one corner and ending to the cross corner, use your palm to remove all air bubble between film and board, set the iron temperature about 130\u00b0C, apply the hot iron down onto the film and PCB, pressing them both flat and putting them under pressure.3. Expose: Place your negative artwork over the rest protective layer. Use a glass to press the artwork to the board snugly, then expose to UV light source or under sunlight, the source of light should be at least 8\" away from the artwork. The best exposure time is depends, but you can easy to recognize it: the color of film is changing from light blue to dark blue.4. Develop: Remember: you need NEGATIVE film developer, Remove the rest protective layer on the film, now only resist left on the board, develop board in developer solution that mixed by 1g developer powder with 100g(or 100ml) water (~1% by weight). After 3 minutes take board out of developer and hold under running water to check,you can always place it back in the developer if needs more time.5.

{"location": "online", "price": 2350.0, "description": "Functional Description The QTR-8RC reflectance sensor array is intended as a line sensor, but it can be used as a general-purpose proximity or reflectance sensor. The module is a convenient carrier for eight IR emitter and receiver (phototransistor) pairs evenly spaced at intervals of 0.375\" (9.525 mm). To use a sensor, you must first charge the output node by applying a voltage to its OUT pin. You can then read the reflectance by withdrawing the externally supplied voltage and timing how long it takes the output voltage to decay due to the integrated phototransistor. Shorter decay time is an indication of greater reflection. This measurement approach has several advantages, especially when coupled with the ability of the QTR-8RC module to turn off LED power: No analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is required Improved sensitivity over voltage-divider analog output Parallel reading of multiple sensors is possible with most microcontrollers Parallel reading allows optimized use of LED power enable option The outputs are all independent, but the LEDs are arranged in pairs to halve current consumption. The LEDs are controlled by a MOSFET with a gate normally pulled high, allowing the LEDs to be turned off by setting the MOSFET gate to a low voltage. Turning the LEDs off might be advantageous for limiting power consumption when the sensors are not in use or for varying the effective brightness of the LEDs through PWM control. This sensor was designed to be used with the board parallel to the surface being sensed. The LED current-limiting resistors for 5 V operation are arranged in two stages; this allows a simple bypass of one stage to enable operation at 3.3 V. The LED current is approximately 20\u201325 mA, making the total board consumption just under 100 mA. The schematic diagram of the module is shown below: For a similar array with three sensors, consider our QTR-3RC reflectance sensor array. The sensors on the QTR-8RC are also available individually as the QTR-1RC reflectance sensor, and the QTR-L-1RC is an alternative designed to be used with the board perpendicular to the surface. QTR sensor size comparison. Clockwise from top left: QTR-3RC, QTR-1RC, QTR-L-1RC, QTR-8RC. Specifications Dimensions: 2.95\" x 0.5\" x 0.125\" (without header pins installed) Operating voltage: 3.3-5.0 V Supply current: 100 mA Output format: 8 digital I/O-compatible signals that can be read as a timed high pulse Optimal sensing distance: 0.125\" (3 mm) Maximum recommended sensing distance: 0.375\" (9.5 mm) Weight without header pins: 0.11 oz (3.09 g) QTR-1RC output (yellow) when 1/8\" above a black line and microcontroller timing of that output (blue). Interfacing the QTR-8RC Outputs to Digital I/O Lines The QTR-8RC module has eight identical sensor outputs that, like the Parallax QTI, require a digital I/O line capable of driving the output line high and then measuring the time for the output voltage to decay. The typical sequence for reading a sensor is: Turn on IR LEDs (optional). Set the I/O line to an output and drive it high. Allow at least 10 \u03bcs for the sensor output to rise. Make the I/O line an input (high impedance). Measure the time for the voltage to decay by waiting for the I/O line to go low. Turn off IR LEDs (optional). These steps can typically be executed in parallel on multiple I/O lines. With a strong reflectance, the decay time can be as low as several dozen microseconds; with no reflectance, the decay time can be up to a few milliseconds. The exact time of the decay depends on your microcontroller\u2019s I/O line characteristics. Meaningful results can be available within 1 ms in typical cases (i.e. when not trying to measure subtle differences in low-reflectance scenarios), allowing up to 1 kHz sampling of all 8 sensors. If lower-frequency sampling is sufficient, substantial power savings can be realized by turning off the LEDs. For example, if a 100 Hz sampling rate is acceptable, the LEDs can be off 90% of the time, lowering average current consumption from 100 mA to 10 mA. Our Pololu AVR library provides functions that make it easy to use these sensors with our Orangutan robot controllers; please see the QTR Reflectance Sensors section of our library command reference for more information. We also have a Arduino library for these sensors. Breaking the Module in Two If you don\u2019t need or cannot fit all eight sensors, you can break off two sensors and still use all 8 sensors as two separate modules, as shown below. The PCB can be scored from both sides along the perforation and then bent until it snaps apart. Each of the two resulting pieces will function as an independent line sensor. Included Components This module ships with a 25-pin 0.1\" header strip and a 100 Ohm through-hole resistor as shown below. You can break the header strip into smaller pieces and solder them onto your reflectance sensor array as desired, or you can solder wires directly to the unit or use a right-angle header strip for a more compact installation. The pins on the module are arranged so that they can all be accessed using either an 11\u00d71 strip or an 8\u00d72 strip. The resistor is required to make the two-sensor array functional after the original eight-sensor array is broken into two pieces. This resistor is only needed once the board has been broken. Solder the included resistor to the 2-sensor array piece as shown to make the separated piece functional.", "title": "QTR-8RC Reflectance Sensor Array-POLOLU", "url": "https://www.lankatronics.com/top-brands/qtr-8rc-reflectance-sensor-array.html", "store": "Lankatronics", "img": "None", "condition": "New"},

{"location": "online", "price": 2350.0, "description": "Functional Description The QTR-8A reflectance sensor array is intended as a line sensor, but it can be used as a general-purpose proximity or reflectance sensor. The module is a convenient carrier for eight IR emitter and receiver (phototransistor) pairs evenly spaced at intervals of 0.375\" (9.525 mm). Each phototransistor is connected to a pull-up resistor to form a voltage divider that produces an analog voltage output between 0 V and VIN (which is typically 5 V) as a function of the reflected IR. Lower output voltage is an indication of greater reflection. The outputs are all independent, but the LEDs are arranged in pairs to halve current consumption. The LEDs are controlled by a MOSFET with a gate normally pulled high, allowing the LEDs to be turned off by setting the MOSFET gate to a low voltage. Turning the LEDs off might be advantageous for limiting power consumption when the sensors are not in use or for varying the effective brightness of the LEDs through PWM control. The LED current-limiting resistors for 5 V operation are arranged in two stages; this allows a simple bypass of one stage to enable operation at 3.3 V. The LED current is approximately 20-25 mA, making the total board consumption just under 100 mA. The schematic diagram of the module is shown below: For a similar array with three sensors, consider our QTR-3A reflectance sensor array. The sensors on the QTR-8A are also available individually as the QTR-1A reflectance sensor, and the QTR-L-1A is an alternative designed to be used with the board perpendicular to the surface. QTR sensor size comparison. Clockwise from top left: QTR-3RC, QTR-1RC, QTR-L-1RC, QTR-8RC. Specifications Dimensions: 2.95\" x 0.5\" x 0.125\" (without header pins installed) Operating voltage: 3.3-5.0 V Supply current: 100 mA Output format: 8 analog voltages Output voltage range: 0 V to supplied voltage Optimal sensing distance: 0.125\" (3 mm) Maximum recommended sensing distance: 0.25\" (6 mm) Weight without header pins: 0.11 oz (3.09 g) Interfacing with the QTR-8A Outputs There are several ways you can interface with the QTR-8A outputs: Use a microcontroller\u2019s analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to measure the voltages. Use a comparator with an adjustable threshold to convert each analog voltage into a digital (i.e. black/white) signal that can be read by the digital I/O line of a microcontroller. Connect each output directly to a digital I/O line of a microcontroller and rely upon its internal comparator. This last method will work if you are able to get high reflectance from your white surface as depicted in the left image, but will probably fail if you have a lower-reflectance signal profile like the one on the right. QTR-1A output 1/8\" away from a spinning white disk with a black line on it. QTR-1A output 3/8\" away from a spinning white disk with a black line on it. Our Pololu AVR library provides functions that make it easy to use these sensors with our Orangutan robot controllers; please see the QTR Reflectance Sensors section of our library command reference for more information. We also have a Arduino library for these sensors. Breaking the Module in Two If you don\u2019t need or cannot fit all eight sensors, you can break off two sensors and still use all 8 sensors as two separate modules, as shown below. The PCB can be scored from both sides along the perforation and then bent until it snaps apart. Each of the two resulting pieces will function as an independent line sensor. Included Components This module ships with a 25-pin 0.1\" header strip and a 100 Ohm through-hole resistor as shown below. You can break the header strip into smaller pieces and solder them onto your reflectance sensor array as desired, or you can solder wires directly to the unit or use a right-angle header strip for a more compact installation. The pins on the module are arranged so that they can all be accessed using either an 11\u00d71 strip or an 8\u00d72 strip. The resistor is required to make the two-sensor array functional after the original eight-sensor array is broken into two pieces. This resistor is only needed once the board has been broken. Solder the included resistor to the 2-sensor array piece as shown to make the separated piece functional.", "title": "QTR-8A Reflectance Sensor Array-POLOLU", "url": "https://www.lankatronics.com/top-brands/qtr-8a-reflectance-sensor-array-pololu.html", "store": "Lankatronics", "img": "None", "condition": "New"},

Hard crushing would cause damage and cracks in the magnetic material. Super strong magnets, please take care. Rare earth neodymium magnets, also known as NdFeB magnets or Neo magnets, are made from an alloy of neodymium, iron and boron. They have excellent magnetic property and are extremely strong for their small size. Neodymium magnets are permanent, and have a high maximum magnetic energy. Due to high ratio of performance over price, neodymium magnets has become extremely popular in almost all applications that require high performance magnets such as motors, sensors, computers, communications, medical equipment, meters, home appliances, craft model, jewelry and so on. Our neodymium magnets, sintered neodymium magnets are available in a variety of shapes and sizes, including disc, cylinder, block, cube, ring, sphere, countersunk. Please feel free to contact us via e-mail or trademanager if you are interested in our magnets or have any questions about our products. Safety Warning about handling neodymium magnets Handling strong magnets in a proper manner is necessary to prevent personal injury and property damage, which include magnet damage. These magnets are not toys. Please do not give neodymium magnets to children under 3 years old. Small magnets pose a choking hazard, and can be lethal if swallowed. In addition, large magnets can easily pinch fingers. So always supervise children when playing with magnets and be sure they are aware of the dangers involved. Please keep magnets away from people who are wearing pacemakers or other medical devices. These magnets could also damage CRT monitors and TV\u2019s. It is recommended to wear gloves when handling magnets. Always handle magnets individually. Do not handle multiple magnets at the same time unless they are widely separated or stacked together. When placing magnets together, place a spacing material between them such as a piece of plastic, wood or cardboard so that they are easy to separate when needed. Maintain a distance of at least 3 feet from other magnets or magnetically susceptible items when handling the magnets. Pay particular attention to scissors, knives, screw drivers or any other sharp metal objects. To separate one magnet from the others, place them on a durable non-metal surface with the magnet-to-be-separated hanging off the edge of the table. Use one hand to firmly hold the other magnets on the table, especially those closest to the magnet being separated. Use the other hand to firmly hold the magnet you are separating. Push it down and away from the other magnets, until a magnetic attraction is no longer felt. Keep the separated magnets a safe distance from each other. Perfect for sticking notes on fridge doors. Great for do-it-yourself projects.

{"location": "online", "price": 1125.0, "description": "Functional Description The QTR-3RC reflectance sensor array is intended as a line sensor, but it can be used as a general-purpose proximity or reflectance sensor. The module is a convenient carrier for three IR emitter and receiver (phototransistor) pairs. With sensors spaced at intervals of 0.375\u2032\u2032 (9.525 mm) along of the board\u2019s longer axis, this array works well as a minimal detector for line-following robots, as line-following courses are commonly made using 3/4\u2032\u2032 (19 mm) black electrical tape. The middle sensor is slightly offset along the short axis of the board. To use a sensor, you must first charge the output node by applying a voltage to its OUT pin. You can then read the reflectance by withdrawing the externally supplied voltage and timing how long it takes the output voltage to decay due to the integrated phototransistor. Shorter decay time is an indication of greater reflection. This measurement approach has several advantages, especially when multiple units are used: No analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is required Improved sensitivity over voltage-divider analog output Parallel reading of multiple sensors is possible with most microcontrollers The LED current-limiting resistors are set to deliver approximately 17 mA to the LEDs when VCC is 5 V, making the total board consumption just over 50 mA. The schematic diagram of the module is shown below: This schematic is also available as a downloadable pdf (117k pdf). For an alternative array with eight sensors and the ability to turn off the IR LEDs to limit power consumption, consider our QTR-8RC reflectance sensor array. For individual reflectance sensors, consider our QTR-1RC and QTR-L-1RC. QTR sensor size comparison. Clockwise from top left: QTR-3RC, QTR-1RC, QTR-L-1RC, QTR-8RC.

The typical sequence for reading a sensor is: Set the I/O line to an output and drive it high. Wait several microseconds to give the 2.2 nF capacitor node time to reach 5 V. Make the I/O line an input (high impedance). Measure the time for the capacitor node voltage to decay by waiting for the I/O line to go low. These steps can typically be executed in parallel on multiple I/O lines. With a strong reflectance, the decay time can be as low as several dozen microseconds; with no reflectance, the decay time can be up to a few milliseconds. The exact time of the decay depends on your microcontroller\u2019s I/O line characteristics. Meaningful results can be available within 1 ms in typical cases (i.e. when not trying to measure subtle differences in low-reflectance scenarios), allowing up to 1 kHz sampling of all three sensors. Our Pololu AVR library provides functions that make it easy to use these sensors with our Orangutan robot controllers; please see the QTR Reflectance Sensors section of our library command reference for more information. We also have a Arduino library for these sensors.

Use a comparator with an adjustable threshold to convert each analog voltage into a digital (i.e. black/white) signal that can be read by the digital I/O line of a microcontroller. Connect each output directly to a digital I/O line of a microcontroller and rely upon its internal comparator. This last method will work if you are able to get high reflectance from your white surface as depicted in the left image, but will probably fail if you have a lower-reflectance signal profile like the one on the right. (Please note that these images show the output of a QTR-1A, which uses a sensor with slightly different characteristics than the ones on the QTR-3A.)

{"location": "online", "price": 4250.0, "description": "Overview The Arduino Motor Shield is based on the L298 (datasheet), which is a dual full-bridge driver designed to drive inductive loads such as relays, solenoids, DC and stepping motors. It lets you drive two DC motors with your Arduino board, controlling the speed and direction of each one independently. You can also measure the motor current absorption of each motor, among other features. The shield is TinkerKit compatible, which means you can quickly create projects by plugging TinkerKit modules to the board. Features Operating Voltage : 5V to 12VMotor controller: L298P, Drives 2 DC motors or 1 stepper motorMax current : 2A per channel or 4A max (with external power supply)Current sensing : 1.65V/AFree running stop and brake function Power The Arduino Motor Shield must be powered only by an external power supply. Because the L298 IC mounted on the shield has two separate power connections, one for the logic and one for the motor supply driver. The required motor current often exceeds the maximum USB current rating. External (non-USB) power can come either from an AC-to-DC adapter (wall-wart) or battery. The adapter can be connected by plugging a 2.1mm center-positive plug into the Arduino's board power jack on which the motor shield is mounted or by connecting the wires that lead the power supply to the Vin and GND screw terminals, taking care to respect the polarities. To avoid possible damage to the Arduino board on which the shield is mounted, we reccomend using an external power supply that provides a voltage between 7 and 12V. If your motor require more than 9V we recommend that you separate the power lines of the shield and the Arduino board on which the shield is mounted. This is possible by cutting the \"Vin Connect\" jumper placed on the back side of the shield. The absolute limit for the Vin at the screw terminals is 18V. The power pins are as follows: Vin on the screw terminal block, is the input voltage to the motor connected to the shield. An external power supply connected to this pin also provide power to the Arduino board on which is mounted. By cutting the \"Vin Connect\"jumper you make this a dedicated power line for the motor. GND Ground on the screw terminal block. The shield can supply 2 amperes per channel, for a total of 4 amperes maximum. Input and Output This shield has two separate channels, called A and B, that each use 4 of the Arduino pins to drive or sense the motor. In total there are 8 pins in use on this shield. You can use each channel separately to drive two DC motors or combine them to drive one bipolar stepper motor. Function pins per Ch. A pins per Ch. BDirection D12 D13PWM D3 D11Brake D9 D8Current Sensing A0 A1 If you don't need the Brake and the Current Sensing and you also need more pins for your application you can disable this features by cutting the respective jumpers on the back side of the shield. The additional sockets on the shield are described as follow: Screw terminal to connect the motors and their power supply. 2 TinkerKit connectors for two Analog Inputs (in white), connected to A2 and A3. 2 TinkerKit connectors for two Aanlog Outputs (in orange in the middle), connected to PWM outputs on pins D5 and D6. 2 TinkerKit connectors for the TWI interface (in white with 4 pins), one for input and the other one for output. Motors connections Brushed DC motor. You can drive two Brushed DC motors by connecting the two wires of each one in the (+) and (-) screw terminals for each channel A and B. In this way you can control its direction by setting HIGH or LOW the DIR Aand DIR B pins, you can control the speed by varying the PWM A and PWM B duty cycle values. The Brake A andBrake B pins, if set HIGH, will effectively brake the DC motors rather than let them slow down by cutting the power. You can measure the current going through the DC motor by reading the SNS0 and SNS1 pins. On each channel will be a voltage proportional to the measured current, which can be read as a normal analog input, through the function analogRead() on the analog input A0 and A1. For your convenience it is calibrated to be 3.3V when the channel is delivering its maximum possible current, that is 2A. Physical Characteristics The maximum length and width of the Motor Shield PCB are 2.7 and 2.1 inches respectively. Four screw holes allow the board to be attached to a surface or case. Note that the distance between digital pins 7 and 8 is 160 mil (0.16\"), not an even multiple of the 100 mil spacing of the other pins.", "title": "Arduino Motor Shield Rev3 (Original)", "url": "https://www.lankatronics.com/top-brands/arduino-motor-shield-rev3.html", "store": "Lankatronics", "img": "None", "condition": "New"},

Ethernet Connection If the pcDuino4 Nano is connected to a network via Ethernet before it is powered on it will automatically obtain an IP after it is powered up. If it is not connected via Ethernet or its DHCP is not activated obtaining an IP will fail and system will hang on for about 15 to 60 seconds The pcDuino4 Nano by default doesn\u2019t have a valid MAC address. If the board connects a network successfully it will automatically generates a random MAC in /etc/network/interfaces.d/eth0 Users can change it to a self-defined valid one:vi \\/etc\\/network\\/interfaces.d\\/eth0 Here is the content of a sample configuration file: auto eth0 allow-hotplug eth0 iface eth0 inet dhcp hwaddress 76:92:d4:85:f3:0f The hwaddress specifies the MAC address. Here the 76:92:d4:85:f3:0f is a random MAC. We suggest users change it to a valid one. Note: when you reset the MAC please make sure your MAC meets IEEE\u2019s definition otherwise it will cause unexpected issues. After you make your change, save, exit and reboot your board or run the following commands to restart the network: systemctl restart networking 3. HDMI resolution Our Debian system\u2019s HDMI resolution is set by a script.bin file in the root directory of the installation TF card\u2019s boot section. By default the resolution is 1080P60. There are multiple script.bin files under that directory for different resolutions. For example if you want to modify the resolution to 720P60 you can use the script-720p-60.bin file to replace the existing one by using the following command: # in TF card boot partition sudo cp script/script-720p-60.bin ./script.bin 4. HDMI Audio Output Our Debian system\u2019s default audio output is the 3.5mm audio jack. You can turn on the HDMI audio by editting the \\/etc\\/asound.conf file: pcm.!default { type hw card 1 device 0 } ctl.!default { type hw card 1 } card 0 points to the 3.5mm audio jack and card 1 points to the HDMI audio. You need to save your changes and reboot your system to make your changes take effect. 5. Test GPU After Debian loads please login from a terminal and run glmark2-es2: glmark2-e 6.

Hundreds of thousands of Arduino boards are already fueling people\u2019s creativity all over the world, everyday. Join us now, Arduino is you! Requires and Arduino board (not included) Operating voltage 5V (supplied from the Arduino Board) Connection with Arduino Uno on pins 2, 3 (Software Serial) and 7 (reset).See these notes for working with a Mega, Mega ADK, or Leonardo. Description The Arduino GSM Shield allows an Arduino board to connect to the internet, make/receive voice calls and send/receive SMS messages. The shield uses a radio modem M10 by Quectel (datasheet). It is possible to communicate with the board using AT commands. The GSM library has a large number of methods for communication with the shield. The shield uses digital pins 2 and 3 for software serial communication with the M10. Pin 2 is connected to the M10\u2019s TX pin and pin 3 to its RX pin. See these notes for working with an Arduino Mega, Mega ADK, or Leonardo. The modem's PWRKEY pin is connected to Arduino pin 7. The M10 is a Quad-band GSM/GPRS modem that works at frequencies GSM850MHz, GSM900MHz, DCS1800MHz andPCS1900MHz. It supports TCP/UDP and HTTP protocols through a GPRS connection. GPRS data downlink and uplink transfer speed maximum is 85.6 kbps. To interface with the cellular network, the board requires a SIM card provided by a network operator. See the getting started page for additional information on SIM usage. The most recent revision of the board uses the 1.0 pinout on rev 3 of the Arduino Uno board. Notes on the Telefonica/Bluevia SIM included with the shield The GSM shield comes bundled with a SIM from Telefonica/Bluevia that will work well for developing machine to machine (M2M) applications. It is not necessary to use this specific card with the shield. You may use any SIM that works on a network in your area. The Bluevia SIM card includes a roaming plan. It can be used on any supported GSM network. There is coverage throughout the Americas and Europe for this SIM, check the Bluevia service availability page for specific countries that have supported networks. Activation of the SIM is handled by Bluevia. Detailed instructions on how to register and activate your SIM online and add credit are included on a small pamphlet that comes with your shield. The SIM must be inserted into a powered GSM shield that is mounted on an Arduino for activation. These SIM card come without a PIN, but it is possible to set one using the GSM library's GSMPIN class. You cannot use the included SIM to place or receive voice calls. You can only place and receive SMS with other SIMs on the Bluevia network. It's not possible to create a server that accepts incoming requests from the public internet. However, the Bluevia SIM will accept incoming requests from other SIM cards on the Bluevia network. For using the voice, and other functions of the shield, you'll need to find a different network provider and SIM. Operators will have different policies for their SIM cards, check with them directly to determine what types of connections are supported. Power requirements It is recommended that the board be powered with an external power supply that can provide between 700mA and 1000mA. Powering an Arduino and the GSM shield from a USB connection is not recommended, as USB cannot provide the required current for when the modem is in heavy use. The modem can pull up to 2A of current at peak usage, which can occur during data transmission. This current is provided through the large orange capacitor on the board's surface. On board indicators The shield contains a number of status LEDs: On: shows the Shield gets power. Status: turns on to when the modem is powered and data is being transferred to/from the GSM/GPRS network. Net: blinks when the modem is communicating with the radio network. On board interfaces The shield supports AIN1 and AOUT1 as audio interfaces; an analog input channel and an analog output channel. The input, exposed on pins MIC1P/MIC1N, can be used for both microphone and line inputs. An electret microphone can be used for this interface. The output, exposed as lines SPK1P/SPK1N, can be used with either a receiver or speaker. Through the modem, it is possible to make voice calls. In order to speak to and hear the other party, you will need to add a speaker and microphone. On page 43 of the modem documentation, there is an example voice and sound circuit that will connect to an earphone: There are two small buttons on the shield. The button labeled \"Reset\" is tied to the Arduino reset pin. When pressed, it will restart the sketch. The button labeled \"Power\" is connected to the modem and will power the modem on and off. For early versions of the shield, it was necessary to press the power button to turn on the modem. Newer versions of the board will turn the modem on automatically. If you have an early version of the shield, and it does not turn on automatically, you can solder a jumper to the CTRL/D7 pad on the reverse side of the board, and it will turn on when an attached Arduino receives power. Several of the modem pins are exposed on the underside of the board. These provide access to the modem for features like speaker output and microphone input.

{"location": "online", "price": 5100.0, "description": "Overview The LilyPad Arduino USB is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega32u4 (datasheet). It has 9 digital input/output pins (of which 4 can be used as PWM outputs and 4 as analog inputs), an 8 MHz resonator, a micro USB connection, a JST connector for a 3.7V LiPo battery, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a battery to get started. The LilyPad Arduino USB differs from previous LilyPad boards in that the ATmega32u4 has built-in USB communication, eliminating the need for a separate USB-to-serial adapter. This allows the LilyPad Arduino USB to appear to a connected computer as a mouse and keyboard, in addition to a virtual (CDC) serial / COM port. It also has other implications for the behavior of the board; these are detailed on the getting started page. Features Microcontroller ATmega32u4Operating Voltage 3.3VInput Voltage 3.8V to 5VDigital I/O Pins 9PWM Channels 4Analog Input Channels 4DC Current per I/O Pin 40 mAFlash Memory 32 KB (ATmega32u4) of which 4 KB used by bootloaderSRAM 2.5 KB (ATmega32u4)EEPROM 1 KB (ATmega32u4)Clock Speed 8 MHz Power The LilyPad Arduino USB can be powered via the micro USB connection or with a 3.7V LiPo battery (connected to the JST connector on the board). Either power source is regulated down to the operating voltage (3.3V) by the on-board MIC5219.The board can be turned on and off with the on-board switch. With the switch in the ON position, the microcontroller receives power and the board runs. With the switch in the \"CHG\" position, the microcontroller doesn't receive power. (This is true whether the board is powered via USB or a battery.)The board contains a MCP73831 LiPo battery charging chip. If the board is connected to both USB and a battery, the USB power will charge the battery. This is true regardless of the position of the switch. The LED above the word \"CHG\" lights up while the battery is being charged. The charging will stop automatically when the battery is fully charged. The power pins are as follows:+ The regulated 3.3V power supply used to power the microcontroller and other components on the board. This can come either from the USB connection or a battery, both via the on-board regulator. This pin is only powered when the on-board switch is in the ON position.- Ground pin. Memory The ATmega32u4 has 32 KB (with 4 KB used for the bootloader). It also has 2.5 KB of SRAM and 1 KB of EEPROM (which can be read and written with the EEPROM library). Input and Output Each of the 9 digital i/o pins on the LilyPad Arduino USB can be used as an input or output, using pinMode(), digitalWrite(), and digitalRead() functions. They operate at 3.3V volts. Each pin can provide or receive a maximum of 40 mA and has an internal pull-up resistor (disconnected by default) of 20-50 kOhms. In addition, some pins have specialized functions:- TWI: 2 (SDA) and 3 (SCL). Support TWI communication using the Wire library.- External Interrupts: 2 and 3. These pins can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low value, a rising or falling edge, or a change in value. See the attachInterrupt() function for details.- PWM: 3, 9, 10, 11, and 13. Provide 8-bit PWM output with the analogWrite() function.- LED: 13. There is a built-in LED connected to digital pin 13. When the pin is HIGH value, the LED is on, when the pin is LOW, it's off.- Analog Inputs: A2-A5. The LilyPad Arduino USB has 4 analog inputs, labeled A0 through A11, all of which can also be used as digital i/o. Each analog input provide 10 bits of resolution (i.e. 1024 different values). By default the analog inputs measure from ground to 5 volts, though is it possible to change the upper end of their range using the analogReference() function.See also the mapping between Arduino pins and ATmega32u4 ports. Communication The LilyPad Arduino USB has a number of facilities for communicating with a computer, another Arduino, or other microcontrollers. The 32U4 also allows for serial (CDC) communication over USB and appears as a virtual com port to software on the computer. The chip also acts as a full speed USB 2.0 device, using standard USB COM drivers. On Windows, a .inf file is required. The Arduino software includes a serial monitor which allows simple textual data to be sent to and from the Arduino board. The RX and TX LEDs on the board will flash when data is being transmitted via the USB connection to the computer. A SoftwareSerial library allows for serial communication on any of the LilyPad's digital pins. The LilyPad Arduino USB also supports I2C (TWI). The Arduino software includes a Wire library to simplify use of theI2C bus; see the documentation for details. The LilyPad Arduino USB appears as a generic keyboard and mouse, and can be programmed to control these input devices using the Keyboard and Mouse classes. Programming The LilyPad Arduino USB can be programmed with the Arduino software (download). Select \"LilyPad Arduino USB\" from the Tools > Board menu (according to the microcontroller on your board). For details, see the reference and tutorials. The ATmega32U4 on the LilyPad Arduino USB comes preburned with a bootloader that allows you to upload new code to it without the use of an external hardware programmer. It communicates using the AVR109 protocol. You can also bypass the bootloader and program the microcontroller through the ICSP (In-Circuit Serial Programming) header. While the holes are too small to insert pins into, you can insert male header pins into the ISP connector on your programmer and press them against the ICSP header on the board (from above). Automatic (Software) Reset and Bootloader Initiation Rather than requiring a physical press of the reset button before an upload, the LilyPad Arduino USB is designed in a way that allows it to be reset by software running on a connected computer. The reset is triggered when the LilyPad's virtual (CDC) serial / COM port is opened at 1200 baud and then closed. When this happens, the processor will reset, breaking the USB connection to the computer (meaning that the virtual serial / COM port will disappear). After the processor resets, the bootloader starts, remaining active for about 8 seconds. The bootloader can also be initiated by pressing the reset button on the LilyPad Arduino USB twice in quick in succession. Pressing the reset button once will reset the board and jump directly to the user sketch, bypassing the bootloader. Note that when the board first powers up, it will jump straight to the user sketch, if present, rather than initiating the bootloader. Because of the way the LilyPad Arduino USB handles reset it's best to let the Arduino software try to initiate the reset before uploading, especially if you are in the habit of pressing the reset button before uploading on other boards. If the software can't reset the board you can always start the bootloader by pressing the reset button on the board twice in quick succession. Physical Characteristics The LilyPad Arduino USB is a circle, approximately 50mm (2\") in diameter. The Micro USB connector extends slightly beyond this diameter. The board itself is .8mm (1/32\") thick (approximately 6.5mm (1/4\") including components, the tallest of which is the JST battery connector).", "title": "Arduino LilyPad USB (Original)", "url": "https://www.lankatronics.com/top-brands/arduino-lilypad-usb-original.html", "store": "Lankatronics", "img": "None", "condition": "New"},

It has 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a RJ45 connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button.NB: Pins 10, 11, 12 and 13 are reserved for interfacing with the Ethernet module and should not be used otherwise. This reduces the number of available pins to 9, with 4 available as PWM outputs.An optional Power over Ethernet module can be added to the board as well.The Ethernet differs from other boards in that it does not have an onboard USB-to-serial driver chip, but has a Wiznet Ethernet interface. This is the same interface found on the Ethernet shield.An onboard microSD card reader, which can be used to store files for serving over the network, is accessible through the SD Library. Pin 10 is reserved for the Wiznet interface, SS for the SD card is on Pin 4.The 6-pin serial programming header is compatible with the USB Serial adapter and also with the FTDI USB cables or with Sparkfun and Adafruit FTDI-style basic USB-to-serial breakout boards. It features support for automatic reset, allowing sketches to be uploaded without pressing the reset button on the board. When plugged into a USB to Serial adapter, the Arduino Ethernet is powered from the adapter. The Revision 3 of the board introduces the standardized 1.0 pinout, that consist in:added SDA and SCL pins that are near to the AREF pin and two other new pins placed near to the RESET pin, this will the opportunity to shield that use i2c or TWI components to be compatible with all the Arduino boards;the IOREF that allow the shields to adapt to the voltage provided from the board.

The adapter can be connected by plugging a 2.1mm center-positive plug into the board's power jack. Leads from a battery can be inserted in the Gnd and Vin pin headers of the POWER connector.The board can operate on an external supply of 6 to 20 volts. If supplied with less than 7V, however, the 5V pin may supply less than five volts and the board may be unstable. If using more than 12V, the voltage regulator may overheat and damage the board. The recommended range is 7 to 12 volts.The power pins are as follows: VIN. The input voltage to the Arduino board when it's using an external power source (as opposed to 5 volts from the USB connection or other regulated power source). You can supply voltage through this pin, or, if supplying voltage via the power jack, access it through this pin. 5V. This pin outputs a regulated 5V from the regulator on the board. The board can be supplied with power either from the DC power jack (7 - 12V), the USB connector (5V), or the VIN pin of the board (7-12V). Supplying voltage via the 5V or 3.3V pins bypasses the regulator, and can damage your board. We don't advise it. 3V3. A 3.3 volt supply generated by the on-board regulator. Maximum current draw is 50 mA. GND. Ground pins. IOREF. This pin on the Arduino board provides the voltage reference with which the microcontroller operates. A properly configured shield can read the IOREF pin voltage and select the appropriate power source or enable voltage translators on the outputs for working with the 5V or 3.3V.

Input and Output Each of the 14 digital pins on the Ethernet board can be used as an input or output, using pinMode(), digitalWrite(), anddigitalRead() functions. They operate at 5 volts. Each pin can provide or receive a maximum of 40 mA and has an internal pull-up resistor (disconnected by default) of 20-50 kOhms. In addition, some pins have specialized functions: Serial: 0 (RX) and 1 (TX). Used to receive (RX) and transmit (TX) TTL serial data. External Interrupts: 2 and 3. These pins can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low value, a rising or falling edge, or a change in value. See the attachInterrupt() function for details. PWM: 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10. Provide 8-bit PWM output with the analogWrite() function. SPI: 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO), 13 (SCK). These pins support SPI communication using the SPI library. LED: 9. There is a built-in LED connected to digital pin 9. When the pin is HIGH value, the LED is on, when the pin is LOW, it's off. On most other arduino boards, this LED is found on pin 13. It is on pin 9 on the Ethernet board because pin 13 is used as part of the SPI connection. The Ethernet board has 6 analog inputs, labeled A0 through A5, each of which provide 10 bits of resolution (i.e. 1024 different values). By default they measure from ground to 5 volts, though is it possible to change the upper end of their range using the AREF pin and the analogReference() function. Additionally, some pins have specialized functionality: TWI: A4 (SDA) and A5 (SCL). Support TWI communication using the Wire library. There are a couple of other pins on the board: AREF. Reference voltage for the analog inputs. Used with analogReference(). Reset. Bring this line LOW to reset the microcontroller. Typically used to add a reset button to shields which block the one on the board. See also the mapping between Arduino pins and ATmega328 ports. Communication The Arduino Ethernet has a number of facilities for communicating with a computer, another Arduino, or other microcontrollers. A SoftwareSerial library allows for serial communication on any of the Uno's digital pins. The ATmega328 also supports TWI and SPI communication. The Arduino software includes a Wire library to simplify use of the TWI bus; see the documentation for details. For SPI communication, use the SPI library. The board also can connect to a wired network via ethernet. When connecting to a network, you will need to provide an IP address and a MAC address. The Ethernet Library is fully supported. The onboard microSD card reader is accessible through the SD Library. When working with this library, SS is on Pin 4. Programming It is possible to program the Arduino Ethernet board in two ways: through the 6 pin serial programming header, or with an external ISP programmer. The 6-pin serial programming header is compatible with FTDI USB cables and the Sparkfun and Adafruit FTDI-style basic USB-to-serial breakout boards including the Arduino USB-Serial connector. It features support for automatic reset, allowing sketches to be uploaded without pressing the reset button on the board. When plugged into a FTDI-style USB adapter, the Arduino Ethernet is powered off the adapter. You can also program the Ethernet board with an external programmer like an AVRISP mkII or USBTinyISP. To set up your environment for burning a sketch with a programmer, follow these instructions. This will delete the serial bootloader, however. All the Ethernet example sketches work as they do with the Ethernet shield. Make sure to change the network settings for your network. Physical Charactoristics The maximum length and width of the Ethernet PCB are 2.7 and 2.1 inches respectively, with the RJ45 connector and power jack extending beyond the former dimension. Four screw holes allow the board to be attached to a surface or case. Note that the distance between digital pins 7 and 8 is 160 mil (0.16\"), not an even multiple of the 100 mil spacing of the other pins.

{"location": "online", "price": 2800.0, "description": "Overview Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple i/o board and a development environment that implements the Processing/Wiring language. Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or can be connected to software on your computer (e.g. Flash, Processing, MaxMSP). The open-source IDE can be downloaded for free (currently for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux). This is the new, smaller, Arduino Mini 05 with ATmega328. The latest version of this board is built around a smaller ATmega328 package, allowing all of the parts to be populated on the top side of the board. Of course, it still requires an external serial connection for programming. The Arduino Mini 05 is a great development module for building compact devices that need to interact with the world around them. Warning: Don't power the Arduino mini with more than 9 volts, or plug the power in backwards: you'll probably kill it. Features: -Microcontroller : ATmega328-Operating Voltage : 5V-Input Voltage : 7-9 V-Digital I/O Pins : 14 (of which 6 provide PWM output)-Analog Input Pins : 8 (of which 4 are broken out onto pins)-DC Current per I/O Pin : 40 mA-Flash Memory : 32 KB (of which 2 KB used by bootloader)-SRAM : 2 KB-EEPROM : 1 KB-Clock Speed : 16 MHz The Arduino Mini can be programmed with the Arduino software . To program the Arduino Mini, you will need a USB Serial adapter or other USB or RS232 to TTL serial adapter. See the page on getting started with the Arduino Mini for instructions.The ATmega328 on the Arduino Mini comes preburned with a bootloader that allows you to upload new code to it without the use of an in-system-programmer. The bootloader communicates using the original STK500 protocol (reference, C header files).You can also bypass the bootloader and program the ATmega328 with ICSP (In-Circuit Serial Programming); see the page on bootloading the Mini for information on wiring up an ICSP header to the Mini and the programmer for instructions on using a programmer to upload a sketch. Input and Output Each of the 14 digital pins on the Mini can be used as an input or output. They operate at 5 volts. Each pin can provide or receive a maximum of 40 mA and has an internal pull-up resistor (disconnected by default) of 20-50 kOhms. Pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11 can provide PWM output; for details see the analogWrite() function. If anything besides the Mini USB (or other) adapter is connected to pins 0 and 1, it will interfere with the USB communication, preventing new code from being uploaded or other communication with the computer. The Mini has 8 analog inputs, each of which provide 10 bits of resolution (i.e. 1024 different values). Inputs 0 to 3 are broken out onto pins; input 4 to 7 require soldering into the provided holes.

{"location": "online", "price": 8650.0, "description": "Overview The Arduino ADK is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega2560 (datasheet). It has a USB host interface to connect with Android based phones, based on the MAX3421e IC. It has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 15 can be used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. The ADK is based on the Mega 2560. Similar to the Mega 2560 and Uno, it features an ATmega8U2 programmed as a USB-to-serial converter.Revision 2 of the MegaADK board has a resistor pulling the 8U2 HWB line to ground, making it easier to put into DFU mode.Revision 3 of the board has the following new features: 1.0 pinout: added SDA and SCL pins that are near to the AREF pin and two other new pins placed near to the RESET pin, the IOREF that allow the shields to adapt to the voltage provided from the board. In future, shields will be compatible both with the board that use the AVR, which operate with 5V and with the Arduino Due that operate with 3.3V. The second one is a not connected pin, that is reserved for future purposes. Stronger RESET circuit. For information on using the board with the Android OS, see Google's ADK documentation. Features -Microcontroller : ATmega2560-Operating Voltage : 5V-Input Voltage (recommended) : 7-12V-Input Voltage (limits) : 6-20V-Digital I/O Pins : 54 (of which 15 provide PWM output)-Analog Input Pins : 16-DC Current per I/O Pin : 40 mA-DC Current for 3.3V Pin : 50 mA-Flash Memory : 256 KB of which 8 KB used by bootloader-SRAM : 8 KB-EEPROM : 4 KB-Clock Speed : 16 MHz Power The Arduino ADK can be powered via the USB connection or with an external power supply. The power source is selected automatically. External (non-USB) power can come either from an AC-to-DC adapter (wall-wart) or battery. The adapter can be connected by plugging a 2.1mm center-positive plug into the board's power jack. Leads from a battery can be inserted in the Gnd and Vin pin headers of the POWER connector. NB: Because the ADK is a USB Host, the phone will attempt to draw power from it when it needs to charge. When the ADK is powered over USB, 500mA total is available for the phone and board.The external power regulator can supply up to 1500mA. 750mA is available for the phone and ADK board. An additional 750mA is allocated for any actuators and sensors attached to the board. A power supply must be capable of providing 1.5A to use this much current. The board can operate on an external supply of 5.5 to 16 volts. If supplied with less than 7V, however, the 5V pin may supply less than five volts and the board may be unstable. If using more than 12V, the voltage regulator may overheat and damage the board. The recommended range is 7 to 12 volts. The power pins are as follows: VIN. The input voltage to the Arduino board when it's using an external power source (as opposed to 5 volts from the USB connection or other regulated power source). You can supply voltage through this pin, or, if supplying voltage via the power jack, access it through this pin. 5V. This pin outputs a regulated 5V from the regulator on the board. The board can be supplied with power either from the DC power jack (7 - 12V), the USB connector (5V), or the VIN pin of the board (7-12V). Supplying voltage via the 5V or 3.3V pins bypasses the regulator, and can damage your board. We don't advise it. 3V3. A 3.3 volt supply generated by the on-board regulator. Maximum current draw is 50 mA. GND. Ground pins. IOREF. This pin on the Arduino board provides the voltage reference with which the microcontroller operates. A properly configured shield can read the IOREF pin voltage and select the appropriate power source or enable voltage translators on the outputs for working with the 5V or 3.3V. Memory The ADK has 256 KB of flash memory for storing code (of which 8 KB is used for the bootloader), 8 KB of SRAM and 4 KB of EEPROM (which can be read and written with the EEPROM library). Input and Output Each of the 50 digital pins on the ADK can be used as an input or output, using pinMode(), digitalWrite(), and digitalRead()functions. They operate at 5 volts. Each pin can provide or receive a maximum of 40 mA and has an internal pull-up resistor (disconnected by default) of 20-50 kOhms. In addition, some pins have specialized functions: Serial: 0 (RX) and 1 (TX); Serial 1: 19 (RX) and 18 (TX); Serial 2: 17 (RX) and 16 (TX); Serial 3: 15 (RX) and 14 (TX). Used to receive (RX) and transmit (TX) TTL serial data. Pins 0 and 1 are also connected to the corresponding pins of the ATmega8U2 USB-to-TTL Serial chip. External Interrupts: 2 (interrupt 0), 3 (interrupt 1), 18 (interrupt 5), 19 (interrupt 4), 20 (interrupt 3), and 21 (interrupt 2). These pins can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low value, a rising or falling edge, or a change in value. See the attachInterrupt() function for details. PWM: 2 to 13 and 44 to 46. Provide 8-bit PWM output with the analogWrite() function. SPI: 50 (MISO), 51 (MOSI), 52 (SCK), 53 (SS). These pins support SPI communication using the SPI library. The SPI pins are also broken out on the ICSP header, which is physically compatible with the Uno, Duemilanove and Diecimila. USB Host: MAX3421E. The MAX3421E comunicate with Arduino with the SPI bus. So it uses the following pins: Digital: 7 (RST), 50 (MISO), 51 (MOSI), 52 (SCK).NB:Please do not use Digital pin 7 as input or output because is used in the comunication with MAX3421E Non broken out on headers: PJ3 (GP_MAX), PJ6 (INT_MAX), PH7 (SS). LED: 13. There is a built-in LED connected to digital pin 13. When the pin is HIGH value, the LED is on, when the pin is LOW, it's off. TWI: 20 (SDA) and 21 (SCL). Support TWI communication using the Wire library. Note that these pins are not in the same location as the TWI pins on the Duemilanove or Diecimila. The ADK has 16 analog inputs, each of which provide 10 bits of resolution (i.e. 1024 different values). By default they measure from ground to 5 volts, though is it possible to change the upper end of their range using the AREF pin and analogReference() function. There are a couple of other pins on the board: AREF. Reference voltage for the analog inputs. Used with analogReference(). Reset. Bring this line LOW to reset the microcontroller. Typically used to add a reset button to shields which block the one on the board. Communication The Arduino ADK has a number of facilities for communicating with a computer, another Arduino, or other microcontrollers. The ATmega2560 provides four hardware UARTs for TTL (5V) serial communication. An ATmega8U2on the board channels one of these over USB and provides a virtual com port to software on the computer (Windows machines will need a .inf file, but OSX and Linux machines will recognize the board as a COM port automatically. The Arduino software includes a serial monitor which allows simple textual data to be sent to and from the board. The RX and TX LEDs on the board will flash when data is being transmitted via the ATmega8U2/16U2 chip and USB connection to the computer (but not for serial communication on pins 0 and 1). A SoftwareSerial library allows for serial communication on any of the ADK's digital pins. The ATmega2560 also supports TWI and SPI communication. The Arduino software includes a Wire library to simplify use of the TWI bus; see the Wire library for details. For SPI communication, use the SPI library. The USB host interface given by MAX3421E IC allows the ADK Arduino to connect and interact to any type of device that have a USB port. For example, allows you to interact with many types of phones, controlling Canon cameras, interfacing with keyboard, mouse and games controllers as Wiimote and PS3. Programming The Arduino ADK can be programmed with the Arduino software (download). For details, see the reference and tutorials. The ATmega2560 on the Arduino ADK comes preburned with a bootloader (the same on Mega 2560) that allows you to upload new code to it without the use of an external hardware programmer. It communicates using the original STK500v2protocol (reference, C header files). You can also bypass the bootloader and program the microcontroller through the ICSP (In-Circuit Serial Programming) header; see these instructions for details.The ATmega8U2 firmware source code is available in the Arduino repository. The ATmega8U2 is loaded with a DFU bootloader, which can be activated by: On Rev1 boards: connecting the solder jumper on the back of the board (near the map of Italy) and then resetting the 8U2. On Rev2 or later boards: there is a resistor that pulling the 8U2/16U2 HWB line to ground, making it easier to put into DFU mode. You can then use Atmel's FLIP software (Windows) or the DFU programmer (Mac OS X and Linux) to load a new firmware. Or you can use the ISP header with an external programmer (overwriting the DFU bootloader). See this user-contributed tutorial for more information. Automatic (Software) Reset Rather then requiring a physical press of the reset button before an upload, the Arduino ADK is designed in a way that allows it to be reset by software running on a connected computer. One of the hardware flow control lines (DTR) of theATmega8U2 is connected to the reset line of the ATmega2560 via a 100 nanofarad capacitor. When this line is asserted (taken low), the reset line drops long enough to reset the chip. The Arduino software uses this capability to allow you to upload code by simply pressing the upload button in the Arduino environment. This means that the bootloader can have a shorter timeout, as the lowering of DTR can be well-coordinated with the start of the upload. This setup has other implications. When the ADK is connected to either a computer running Mac OS X or Linux, it resets each time a connection is made to it from software (via USB). For the following half-second or so, the bootloader is running on the ADK. While it is programmed to ignore malformed data (i.e. anything besides an upload of new code), it will intercept the first few bytes of data sent to the board after a connection is opened. If a sketch running on the board receives one-time configuration or other data when it first starts, make sure that the software with which it communicates waits a second after opening the connection and before sending this data. The ADK contains a trace that can be cut to disable the auto-reset. The pads on either side of the trace can be soldered together to re-enable it. It's labeled \"RESET-EN\". You may also be able to disable the auto-reset by connecting a 110 ohm resistor from 5V to the reset line; see this forum thread for details. USB Overcurrent Protection The Arduino ADK has a resettable polyfuse that protects your computer's USB ports from shorts and overcurrent. Although most computers provide their own internal protection, the fuse provides an extra layer of protection. If more than 500 mA is applied to the USB port, the fuse will automatically break the connection until the short or overload is removed. Physical Characteristics and Shield Compatibility The maximum length and width of the ADK PCB are 4 and 2.1 inches respectively, with the USB connector and power jack extending beyond the former dimension. Three screw holes allow the board to be attached to a surface or case. Note that the distance between digital pins 7 and 8 is 160 mil (0.16\"), not an even multiple of the 100 mil spacing of the other pins. The ADK is designed to be compatible with most shields designed for the Uno, Diecimila or Duemilanove. Digital pins 0 to 13 (and the adjacent AREF and GND pins), analog inputs 0 to 5, the power header, and ICSP header are all in equivalent locations. Further the main UART (serial port) is located on the same pins (0 and 1), as are external interrupts 0 and 1 (pins 2 and 3 respectively). SPI is available through the ICSP header on both the ADK and Duemilanove / Diecimila.Please note that I2C is not located on the same pins on the ADK (20 and 21) as the Duemilanove / Diecimila (analog inputs 4 and 5).

{"location": "online", "price": 5250.0, "description": "Descriptions: The infra-red camera module v2 (Pi NoIR) replaced the original PiNoIR camera in April 2016. The v2 camera has a Sony IMX219 8-megapixel sensor (compared to the 5-megapixel OmniVision OV5647 sensor of the original camera). The Pi NoIR gives you everything the regular camera module offers, with one difference: it does not employ an infrared filter. (NoIR = No Infrared.) This means that pictures you take by daylight will look decidedly curious, but it gives you the ability to see in the dark with infrared lighting. We bundle a little square of blue gel with the Pi NoIR, which you can use with the Pi NoIR to monitor the health of green plants. The Pi NoIR is very popular among wildlife hobbyists: with a few infra-red LEDs, you can monitor what nocturnal animals are doing in your garden without disturbing them. The camera works with all models of Raspberry Pi 1, 2 and 3. It can be accessed through the MMAL and V4L APIs, and there are numerous third-party libraries built for it, including the Picamera Python library. See the Getting Started with Picamera resource to learn how to use it.

{"location": "online", "price": 3450.0, "description": "The latest addition to the Arduino family is here! The Arduino Leonardo is a microcontroller board based on the exciting USB-enabled ATmega32u4 (datasheet). This chip has about the same amount of flash, RAM and capability as the ATmega328 found in the UNO. It has 20 digital input/output pins (of which 7 can be used as PWM outputs and 12 as analog inputs), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a micro USB connection, a spot for a 2.1mm power jack, an ICSP header breakout, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable to get started. This version of the Leonardo does not come with any headers attached for an ultra-thin, light-weight Arduino! We also have the version with headers for those who want to plug in shields without any soldering. The Leonardo differs from all preceding boards in that the ATmega32u4 has built-in USB communication, eliminating the need for a secondary chip (such as an FTDI friend, FTDI cable or the USB/Serial converter on the UNO). On one hand this means that sketches on the Leo are a little bigger because it's also handling USB interaction. On the other hand, it allows the Leonardo to appear to a connected computer as a mouse and/or keyboard, in addition to a virtual (CDC) serial / COM port. It also has other implications for the behavior of the board; these are detailed on the getting started page. We're very excited to have a small shipment of Leo's in stock. Please note that this board is very new and so is best used by people with existing Arduino experience as there may be a bug that trips up beginners. It is probably not going to work with nearly any shields other than the proto shield. We haven't gone through and tested it with all the Adafruit shields and don't guarantee it will work until we've sat down and done a lot of testing and coding, so keep that in mind! This board is only supported in the latest Arduino IDE 1.0.1 so you will also need to update the IDE.", "title": "Arduino Leonardo WITHOUT Headers(Original)", "url": "https://www.lankatronics.com/robot-accessories/original-arduino-leonardo.html", "store": "Lankatronics", "img": "None", "condition": "New"},

As more USB protocols are added to Teensyduino, despite its low cost, Teensy-LC will be up the task. Hardware Timers Many Arduino libraries require a hardware timer. Traditional Arduino products have 3 or 4 timers, with only 1 or 2 providing more than 8 bit resolution. Teensy-LC has a total of 7 timers, all of them with 16 or more bits of resolution, to allow excellent compatibility with easy-to-use libraries. Many combinations of popular libraries, which would normally conflict, can seamlessly run together on Teensy LC and Teensy 3.1. Analog Input & Output at 12 Bit Resolution Analog signals are critically important to many projects. Teensy-LC has 13 pins than can function as analog inputs. The effective analog resolution is 12 bits. It also has a true 12 bit digital to analog converter, for an analog output signal. 32 bit ARM Cortex M0+ Processor The Cortex-M0+ processor is a powerful, full 32 bit CPU, designed for lower power, lower cost devices. Cortex-M0+ has fewer instructions and a simpler bus structure than the more powerful Cortex-M4 on Teensy 3.1. For simple code, M0+ often runs at similar speed, when running at the same clock frequency. For math-intensive applications, Cortex-M4 can be significantly faster, and of course it supports higher clock rates. Cortex-M0+ at 48 MHz is much faster than 8 bit AVR processors at 16 MHz, especially when manipulating 16 and 32 bit variables! 5 Volt Buffer For WS2812/NeoPixel LED Projects Teensy-LC provides a 5V output to directly drive WS2812/NeoPixel LEDs. A 74LV1T125 buffer is connected to pin 17, with the increased output voltage available on another pin.

We designed Feather to be a new standard for portable microcontroller cores. This is the Feather 32u4 Basic Proto, it has a bunch of prototyping space built right in We have other boards in the Feather family, check'em out here! At the Feather 32u4's heart is at ATmega32u4 clocked at 8 MHz and at 3.3V logic, a chip setup we've had tons of experience with as it's the same as the Flora. This chip has 32K of flash and 2K of RAM, with built in USB so not only does it have a USB-to-Serial program & debug capability built in with no need for an FTDI-like chip, it can also act like a mouse, keyboard, USB MIDI device, etc. This chip is well supported in the Arduino IDE and can run just about every sensor/library out there. To make it easy to use for portable projects, we added a connector for any of our 3.7V Lithium polymer batteries and built in battery charging. You don't need a battery, it will run just fine straight from the micro USB connector. But, if you do have a battery, you can take it on the go, then plug in the USB to recharge. The Feather will automatically switch over to USB power when its available. We also tied the battery thru a divider to an analog pin, so you can measure and monitor the battery voltage to detect when you need a recharge. Here's some handy specs! Measures 2.0\" x 0.9\" x 0.28\" (51mm x 23mm x 8mm) without headers soldered in Light as a (large?) feather - 4.8 grams ATmega32u4 @ 8MHz with 3.3V logic/power 3.3V regulator with 500mA peak current output USB native support, comes with USB bootloader and serial port debugging You also get tons of pins - 20 GPIO pins Hardware Serial, hardware I2C, hardware SPI support 7 x PWM pins 10 x analog inputs (one is used to measure the battery voltage) Built in 100mA lipoly charger with charging status indicator LED Pin #13 red LED for general purpose blinking Power/enable pin 4 mounting holes Reset button The Feather 32u4 Basic Proto has some extra space left over, so we give you a tiny little prototyping area.

As the latest member of the LinkIt family, it uses the MediaTek MT7697 SoC and aims at providing lightweight IoT solution. It may reminds you of LinkIt Smart 7688/Duo, another development board which released in 2015. Both of them are born for IoT however they are quite different. The chipset of LinkIt 7697 is MT7697, a highly integrated single chip which features an application processor, a low power 1x1 11n single-band Wi-Fi subsystem, a Bluetooth subsystem, and a Power Management Unit. The application processor subsystem contains ARM Cortex-M4F MCU. It also includes many peripherals, including UART, I2C, SPI, I2S, PWM, IrDA, and auxiliary ADC. For programming, you can program the board with the native LinkIt SDK using GCC, IAR embedded workbench, or KEIL uVision. In order to make it easier to use, LinkIt 7697 also provides a porting layer to the popular Arduino IDE - so that you can use your existing Arduino sketches and peripheral driver libraries. If comparing with Arduino UNO, you will find that the LinkIt 7697 is more powerful as it can run more complicated and store larger program, IoT application friendly and cost effective, you can even plug it into a breadboard directly and start your IoT project right away. Features Lightweight IoT application Cortex-M4 with FPU@192Mhz Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n (2.4G) Support BLE Pin-out for GPIO, UART, I2C, SPI, PWM, EINT, ADC, IrDA, I2S Open software development environment FreeRTOS, Arduino, BlocklyDuino 352KB RAM and 4MB Flash CE, FCC, NCC certified Hardware Overview Specification Product Name LinkIt 7697 Module wrtnode7(wrtnode.com) Chipset MT7697Cortex-M4 with FPU @ 192Mhz RAM 352 KB Flash 4 MB Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n (2.4G) Bluetooth 4.2 LE Dimension 48x26 mm Operating Voltage 3v3 Input Voltage 5v (microUSB) USB2UART CP2102N Peripheral Interfaces GPIO x18 UART x2 I2C x1 SPI x1 PWM x18 EINT x4 ADC x4 (0~2.5V) IrDA x1 I2S x1 Debug Interfaces SWD x1 Pinout", "title": "LinkIt 7697", "url": "https://www.lankatronics.com/robot-accessories/linkit-7697.html", "store": "Lankatronics", "img": "None", "condition": "New"},

The sensor includes a temperature/humidity sensor module from Sensiron in a sinter metal mesh encasing. The casing is weatherproof and will keep water from seeping into the body of the sensor and damaging it, but allows air to pass through so that it can measure the humidity (moisture) of the soil. It is designed to be submersible in water, but it\u2019s always best to avoid long-term (over 1 hour at a time) submersion, if you need something that can be submerged for over an hour you may want to find a different sensor. It can also be simply placed outside for exterior weather sensing. Humidity readings have 4.5% precision, temperature is 0.5% precision. A microcontroller is required to interface. The sensor is not washed after reflow and is rehydrated according to datasheet requirements. The sensor is essentially just a Sensiron SHT-10 with the 4 data/power wires brought out so any SHT-1X code for a microcontroller will work. The sensor works with 3 or 5V logic. The 1 meter long cable has four wires: Red = VCC (3-5VDC), Black or Green = Ground, Yellow = Clock, Blue = Data Don\u2019t forget to connect a 10K resistor from the blue Data line to VCC.

The v2 camera has a Sony IMX219 8-megapixel sensor (compared to the 5-megapixel OmniVision OV5647 sensor of the original camera). The Pi NoIR gives you everything the regular camera module offers, with one difference: it does not employ an infrared filter. (NoIR = No Infrared.) This means that pictures you take by daylight will look decidedly curious, but it gives you the ability to see in the dark with infrared lighting. We bundle a little square of blue gel with the Pi NoIR, which you can use with the Pi NoIR to monitor the health of green plants. The Pi NoIR is very popular among wildlife hobbyists: with a few infra-red LEDs, you can monitor what nocturnal animals are doing in your garden without disturbing them. The camera works with all models of Raspberry Pi 1, 2 and 3. It can be accessed through the MMAL and V4L APIs, and there are numerous third-party libraries built for it, including the Picamera Python library.

They consist of a pattern of resistive foil which is mounted on a backing material. They operate on the principle that as the foil is subjected to stress, the resistance of the foil changes in a defined way. Strain Gauge, also known as Foil Gauge is a device whose electrical resistance varies in proportion to the amount of strain in the device. The most commonly used strain gauge is the bonded metallic strain gage. It consists of a fine wire or metallic foil arranged in a grid pattern as shown below. The white part in the above image is a high quality metallic wire of uniform cross-section which is bonded to a thin backing, called the carrier, which is attached directly to the test specimen or the transducer element. The strain experienced by the specimen/element is transferred to the strain gage, which responds with a linear change in electrical resistance. Strain gauges are used for Stress Analysis and Manufacture of Transducers. Two distinct classes of strain gauges are available for Stress Analysis and Transducers. Further, within the transducer class, strain gauges for steel and aluminium are available. Strain gages are available commercially with nominal resistance values of 120\u03a9, 350\u03a9 and 1000\u03a9. A fundamental parameter of the strain gage which expresses it's sensitivity to strain is the gauge factor. Gage factor is defined as the ratio of change in resistance to the change in length (strain). The gage factor for metallic strain gages is typically around 2. Strain gauges must be properly mounted onto the element/test specimen so that the strain is accurately transferred from the test specimen > adhesive > strain gage > foil.", "title": "Resistive Strain Foil (High Precision)", "url": "https://www.lankatronics.com/modules-sensors/resistive-strain-foil-high-precision.html", "store": "Lankatronics", "img": "None", "condition": "New"},

{"location": "online", "price": 8900.0, "description": "The Leonardo ETH is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega32U4 (datasheet) and the new W5500 TCP/IP Embedded Ethernet Controller (datasheet). It has 20 digital input/output pins (of which 7 can be used as PWM outputs and 12 as analog inputs), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a RJ45 connection, a micro USB connector, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.The Leonardo ETH differs from the preceding Ethernet board in that the ATmega32u4 has built-in USB communication, eliminating the need for an external USB-to-serial converter. This allows the Leonardo ETH to appear to a connected computer as a mouse and keyboard, in addition to a virtual (CDC) serial / COM port. It also has other implications for the behaviour of the board. Plus, it has the new W5500 TCP/IP Embedded Ethernet Controller onboard.An optional Power over Ethernet module can be added to the board as well.The Leonardo ETH has the same Wiznet Ethernet interface as the Ethernet Shield 2.An onboard microSD card reader, which can be used to store files for serving over the network, is accessible through the SD Library. Pin 10 is reserved for the Wiznet interface, SS for the SD card is on Pin 4. The board uses the standardized 1.0 pinout, consisting of: added SDA and SCL pins: beside the AREF pin, two TWI pins have been added. This will allow to connect the Leonardo ETH to Shields that use the I2C or TWI bus communication for their functioning. the IOREF: it allows the shields to adapt to the IO voltage level provided by the Board. The Shield that uses the IOREF pin will be compatible with both 3V3 and 5V (e.g Due and Uno) IO levels Arduino Boards. Next to the IOREF pin you can find another (currently not in use) pin, that is reserved for future usage.

{"location": "online", "price": 3750.0, "description": "Introduction An ultrasonic sensor measures distance by calculating the time difference between sending a signal and receiving an echo from an object. It uses echolocation to measure distances, just like a bat. The URM07 is an ultra low-power sensor. The effect range is up to 7.5m, and it has a wide range power supply of 3.0 - 5.5V. It is directly compatible with 3.3V or 5V devices such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi. etc. The average operating current is only 5mA and standby current is only 14uA. According to the principle of ultrasound sensors, the accuracy of the distance value will be affected by the air temperature and wind direction, so using a DFRobot URM07 built-in temperature sensor, you can read the ambient temperature, and automatically calculate temperature compensation. The sensor uses an integrated ultrasonic probe with a detection angle of approximately 60\u00b0 in a compact and lightweight unit. The unit uses a 2.54mm pitch 4Pin interface, using UART communication, compatible with most common microcontrollers. URM07 Detecting Angle URM07 UART ultrasonic distance sensors have undertaken rigorous road testing and optimization.

{"location": "online", "price": 10000.0, "description": "Overview The Arduino Ethernet is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328 (datasheet). It has 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a RJ45 connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button.NB: Pins 10, 11, 12 and 13 are reserved for interfacing with the Ethernet module and should not be used otherwise. This reduces the number of available pins to 9, with 4 available as PWM outputs.An optional Power over Ethernet module can be added to the board as well.The Ethernet differs from other boards in that it does not have an onboard USB-to-serial driver chip, but has a Wiznet Ethernet interface. This is the same interface found on the Ethernet shield.An onboard microSD card reader, which can be used to store files for serving over the network, is accessible through the SD Library. Pin 10 is reserved for the Wiznet interface, SS for the SD card is on Pin 4.The 6-pin serial programming header is compatible with the USB Serial adapter and also with the FTDI USB cables or with Sparkfun and Adafruit FTDI-style basic USB-to-serial breakout boards. It features support for automatic reset, allowing sketches to be uploaded without pressing the reset button on the board. When plugged into a USB to Serial adapter, the Arduino Ethernet is powered from the adapter. The Revision 3 of the board introduces the standardized 1.0 pinout, that consist in:added SDA and SCL pins that are near to the AREF pin and two other new pins placed near to the RESET pin, this will the opportunity to shield that use i2c or TWI components to be compatible with all the Arduino boards;the IOREF that allow the shields to adapt to the voltage provided from the board. Shields that use the IOREF pin will be compatible both with the board that use the AVR, which operate with 5V and with the Arduino Due that operate with 3.3V. Next to the IOREF pin there is a not connected pin, that is reserved for future purposes. Features Microcontroller : ATmega328Operating Voltage : 5VInput Voltage Plug (recommended) : 7-12VInput Voltage Plug (limits) : 6-20VInput Voltage PoE (limits) : 36-57VDigital I/O Pins : 14 (of which 4 provide PWM output)Arduino Pins reserved: 10 to 13 used for SPI 4 used for SD card 2 W5100 interrupt (when bridged)Analog Input Pins : 6DC Current per I/O Pin : 40 mADC Current for 3.3V Pin : 50 mAFlash Memory : 32 KB (ATmega328) of which 0.5 KB used by bootloaderSRAM : 2 KB (ATmega328)EEPROM : 1 KB (ATmega328)Clock Speed : 16 MHz Power The board can also be powered via an external power supply, an optional Power over Ethernet (PoE) module, or by using a FTDI cable/USB Serial connector.External power can come either from an AC-to-DC adapter (wall-wart) or battery. The adapter can be connected by plugging a 2.1mm center-positive plug into the board's power jack. Leads from a battery can be inserted in the Gnd and Vin pin headers of the POWER connector.The board can operate on an external supply of 6 to 20 volts. If supplied with less than 7V, however, the 5V pin may supply less than five volts and the board may be unstable. If using more than 12V, the voltage regulator may overheat and damage the board. The recommended range is 7 to 12 volts.The power pins are as follows: VIN. The input voltage to the Arduino board when it's using an external power source (as opposed to 5 volts from the USB connection or other regulated power source). You can supply voltage through this pin, or, if supplying voltage via the power jack, access it through this pin. 5V. This pin outputs a regulated 5V from the regulator on the board. The board can be supplied with power either from the DC power jack (7 - 12V), the USB connector (5V), or the VIN pin of the board (7-12V). Supplying voltage via the 5V or 3.3V pins bypasses the regulator, and can damage your board. We don't advise it. 3V3. A 3.3 volt supply generated by the on-board regulator. Maximum current draw is 50 mA. GND. Ground pins. IOREF. This pin on the Arduino board provides the voltage reference with which the microcontroller operates. A properly configured shield can read the IOREF pin voltage and select the appropriate power source or enable voltage translators on the outputs for working with the 5V or 3.3V. The optional PoE module is designed to extract power from a conventional twisted pair Category 5 Ethernet cable: IEEE802.3af compliant Low output ripple and noise (100mVpp) Input voltage range 36V to 57V Overload and short-circuit protection 9V Output High efficiency DC/DC converter: typ 75% @ 50% load 1500V isolation (input to output) NB: the Power over Ethernet module is proprietary hardware not made by Arduino, it is a third party accessory. For more information, see the datasheet When using the power adapter, power can come either from an AC-to-DC adapter (wall-wart) or battery. The adapter can be connected by plugging a 2.1mm center-positive plug into the board's power jack. Leads from a battery can be inserted in the Gnd and Vin pin headers of the POWER connector. The board can operate on an external supply of 6 to 20 volts. If supplied with less than 7V, however, the 5V pin may supply less than five volts and the board may be unstable. If using more than 12V, the voltage regulator may overheat and damage the board. The recommended range is 7 to 12 volts. Memory The ATmega328 has 32 KB (with 0.5 KB used for the bootloader). It also has 2 KB of SRAM and 1 KB of EEPROM (which can be read and written with the EEPROM library). Input and Output Each of the 14 digital pins on the Ethernet board can be used as an input or output, using pinMode(), digitalWrite(), anddigitalRead() functions. They operate at 5 volts. Each pin can provide or receive a maximum of 40 mA and has an internal pull-up resistor (disconnected by default) of 20-50 kOhms. In addition, some pins have specialized functions: Serial: 0 (RX) and 1 (TX). Used to receive (RX) and transmit (TX) TTL serial data. External Interrupts: 2 and 3. These pins can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low value, a rising or falling edge, or a change in value. See the attachInterrupt() function for details. PWM: 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10. Provide 8-bit PWM output with the analogWrite() function. SPI: 10 (SS), 11 (MOSI), 12 (MISO), 13 (SCK). These pins support SPI communication using the SPI library. LED: 9. There is a built-in LED connected to digital pin 9. When the pin is HIGH value, the LED is on, when the pin is LOW, it's off. On most other arduino boards, this LED is found on pin 13. It is on pin 9 on the Ethernet board because pin 13 is used as part of the SPI connection. The Ethernet board has 6 analog inputs, labeled A0 through A5, each of which provide 10 bits of resolution (i.e. 1024 different values). By default they measure from ground to 5 volts, though is it possible to change the upper end of their range using the AREF pin and the analogReference() function. Additionally, some pins have specialized functionality: TWI: A4 (SDA) and A5 (SCL). Support TWI communication using the Wire library. There are a couple of other pins on the board: AREF. Reference voltage for the analog inputs. Used with analogReference(). Reset. Bring this line LOW to reset the microcontroller. Typically used to add a reset button to shields which block the one on the board. See also the mapping between Arduino pins and ATmega328 ports. Communication The Arduino Ethernet has a number of facilities for communicating with a computer, another Arduino, or other microcontrollers. A SoftwareSerial library allows for serial communication on any of the Uno's digital pins. The ATmega328 also supports TWI and SPI communication. The Arduino software includes a Wire library to simplify use of the TWI bus; see the documentation for details. For SPI communication, use the SPI library. The board also can connect to a wired network via ethernet. When connecting to a network, you will need to provide an IP address and a MAC address. The Ethernet Library is fully supported. The onboard microSD card reader is accessible through the SD Library. When working with this library, SS is on Pin 4. Programming It is possible to program the Arduino Ethernet board in two ways: through the 6 pin serial programming header, or with an external ISP programmer. The 6-pin serial programming header is compatible with FTDI USB cables and the Sparkfun and Adafruit FTDI-style basic USB-to-serial breakout boards including the Arduino USB-Serial connector. It features support for automatic reset, allowing sketches to be uploaded without pressing the reset button on the board. When plugged into a FTDI-style USB adapter, the Arduino Ethernet is powered off the adapter. You can also program the Ethernet board with an external programmer like an AVRISP mkII or USBTinyISP. To set up your environment for burning a sketch with a programmer, follow these instructions. This will delete the serial bootloader, however. All the Ethernet example sketches work as they do with the Ethernet shield. Make sure to change the network settings for your network. Physical Charactoristics The maximum length and width of the Ethernet PCB are 2.7 and 2.1 inches respectively, with the RJ45 connector and power jack extending beyond the former dimension. Four screw holes allow the board to be attached to a surface or case. Note that the distance between digital pins 7 and 8 is 160 mil (0.16\"), not an even multiple of the 100 mil spacing of the other pins.

Pins are designed for easy installation and are solderable. Horizontal and vertical mounting options are offered. The active sensor area is shielded for improved RFI/EMI rejection. Rugged, flexible PVDF sensing element withstands high shock overload. Sensor has excellent linearity and dynamic range, and may be used for detecting either continuous vibration or impacts. The mass may be modified to obtain alternative frequency response and sensitivity selection (consult factory). The MiniSense 100 acts as a cantilever-beam accelerometer. When the beam is mounted horizontally, acceleration in the vertical plane creates bending in the beam, due to the inertia of the mass at the tip of the beam. Strain in the beam creates a piezoelectric response, which may be detected as a charge or voltage output across the electrodes of the sensor. The sensor may be used to detect either continuous or impulsive vibration or impacts. For excitation frequencies below the resonant frequency of the sensor, the device produces a linear output governed by the \"baseline\" sensitivity. The sensitivity at resonance is significantly higher. Impacts containing high frequency components will excite the resonance fre-quency, as shown in the plot above (response of MiniSense 100 to a single half-sine impulse at 100 Hz, of amplitude 0.9 g). The ability of the sensor to detect low frequency motion is strongly influenced by the external electrical circuit.

The ADC Differential Pi is based on two Microchip MCP3424 A/D converters each containing 4 analogue inputs. The MCP3424 is a delta-sigma A/D converter with low noise differential inputs. Not sure which ADC you need ? Check our Analogue to Digital Buyers guide to compare our ADC expansion boards. We designed the ADC Differential Pi as a companion for our ADC Pi. Unlike the ADC Pi the ADC Differential Pi does not include any voltage dividers so the inputs can be used to measure a differential voltage range of \u00b12.048V. This is useful for measuring inputs below \u00b12.048V or allows you to use your own voltage divider to measure higher voltages. The ADC Differential Pi is powered through the host Raspberry Pi using the GPIO port and extended pins on the GPIO connector allow you to stack the ADC Differential Pi along with other expansion boards. The two MCP3424 A/D converters communicate via i2c to the host Raspberry Pi giving you eight analogue inputs to use. A logic level converter is included on the ADC Pi Plus board giving you a buffered 5V i2c port making it easy to add other I2C devices which operate at 5 volts without damaging the raspberry pi 3.3 volt i2c port. The i2c buffer uses N-channel mosfets with a maximum drain current of 100mA. The I2C address bits are selectable using the on-board jumpers. The MCP3424 supports up to 8 different I2C addresses so with two A/D converters on each ADC Differential Pi you can stack up to 4 ADC Differential Pi boards on a single Raspberry Pi giving you 32 ADC inputs. The MCP3424 contains an on-board 2.048V reference voltage with an input range of \u00b12.048V differentially (full scale range of 4.096V/PGA). A programmable Gain Amplifier gives the user a selectable gain of x1, x2, x4 or x8 before the analogue to digital conversion takes place. The data rate for analogue to digital conversions is 3.75 (18 bit), 15 (16 bit), 60 (14 bit) or 240 (12 bit) samples per second. Data rate and resolution can be configured within software using the I2C interface. We have a knowledge base article, ADC Sample Rate Comparison which has more detailed sample information and test scripts to compare the different MCP2424 ADC chip bit and sample rates. Unused inputs should be tied to ground. Legacy Delta Sigma Pi Versions See our KB article for previous versions of this board.

Mechanical Drawings Click image to enlarge Assembly The ADC Differential Pi is supplied with the 40 pin GPIO connector and the 12 pin address connector unsoldered. Before using the ADC Differential Pi you will need to solder both connectors onto the PCB. We suggest soldering the 40 pin GPIO connector first and then the address select connector. Soldering the address select connector first will make it difficult to access the three corner pins on the GPIO connector. Assembly for the ADC Differential Pi is the same as on our ADC Pi Plus. PCB Header Assembly Jig Download and print our PCB Header Assembly Jig to hold your circuit board when soldering the header pins. I2C Address Selection The MCP3424 analogue to digital converter contains two address select pins which can be tied to Vss, Vdd or left floating. This gives 8 possible I2C addresses for each chip. The ADC Differential Pi contains two MCP3424 chips so you can stack up to 4 ADC Differential Pi boards on a single Raspberry Pi. To simplify address selection on the ADC Differential Pi we have included a set of address selection pins which can be configured using the included jumpers. The illustrations below show the four recommended configurations for your ADC Differential Pi and the associated I2C addresses. Note:Disconnect the ADC Differential Pi from the Raspberry Pi before changing the address pins. You may need to short the 5V and ground with a resistor to discharge the capacitors in order for the new addresses to be recognised. Warning Do not under any circumstanced connect the two centre pins together. This will create a direct short between the 5V and ground pins and will damage or destroy your Raspberry Pi and ADC Pi Plus board.

{"location": "online", "price": 19750.0, "description": "Measuring SpO2 aka Specific Oxygen levels in blood has never been so easy! With the new AFE4490 IC our shield does an amazing job of measuring heart rate as well as SpO2 values. Pulse Oximetry is an indirect method of measuring the oxygen levels in the blood. The sensor measures the amount of red and IR light wavelengths absorbed by blood to calculate the oxygen levels in blood. The measurement is done by a probe that clips on to a finger and contains emitters as well as a light sensor. For more information on how exactly Pulse Oximetry works, check this out here.

{"location": "online", "price": 425.0, "description": "The DRV8825 stepper motor driver carrier is a breakout board for TI's DRV8825 microstepping bipolar stepper motor driver. The module has a pinout and interface that are nearly identical to those of our A4988 stepper motor driver board, so it can be used as a higher-performance drop-in replacement for those boards in many applications.The DRV8825 features adjustable current limiting, overcurrent and overtemperature protection, and six microstep resolutions (down to 1/32-step). It operates from 8.2 \u2013 45 V and can deliver up to approximately 1.5 A per phase without a heat sink or forced air flow (rated for up to 2.2 A per coil with sufficient additional cooling).1)Simple step and direction control interface2)Six different step resolutions: full-step, half-step, 1/4-step, 1/8-step, 1/16-step, and 1/32-step3)Adjustable current control lets you set the maximum current output with a potentiometer, which lets you use voltages above your stepper motor's rated voltage to achieve higher step rates4)45 V maximum supply voltage5)Built-in regulator (no external logic voltage supply needed)6)Can interface directly with 3.3 V and 5 V systems7)Over-temperature thermal shutdown, over-current shutdown, and under-voltage lockout8)Short-to-ground and shorted-load protection9)4-layer, 2 oz copper PCB for improved heat dissipation10)Exposed solderable ground pad below the driver IC on the bottom of the PCB11)Module size, pinout, and interface match those of our A4988 stepper motor driver carriers in most respects (see the bottom of this page for more information)This product is a carrier board or breakout board for TI\u2019s DRV8825 stepper motor driver; we therefore recommend careful reading of the DRV8825 datasheet (1MB pdf) before using this product. This stepper motor driver lets you control one bipolar stepper motor at up to 2.2 A output current per coil (see the Power Dissipation Considerations section below for more information). Here are some of the driver\u2019s key features:Simple step and direction control interfaceSix different step resolutions: full-step, half-step, 1/4-step, 1/8-step, 1/16-step, and 1/32-stepAdjustable current control lets you set the maximum current output with a potentiometer, which lets you use voltages above your stepper motor\u2019s rated voltage to achieve higher step ratesIntelligent chopping control that automatically selects the correct current decay mode (fast decay or slow decay)45 V maximum supply voltageBuilt-in regulator (no external logic voltage supply needed)Can interface directly with 3.3 V and 5 V systemsOver-temperature thermal shutdown, over-current shutdown, and under-voltage lockoutShort-to-ground and shorted-load protection4-layer, 2 oz copper PCB for improved heat dissipationExposed solderable ground pad below the driver IC on the bottom of the PCBModule size, pinout, and interface match those of our A4988 stepper motor driver carriers in most respects (see the bottom of this page for more information)We also carry a DRV8824 stepper motor driver carrier that can serve as a direct substitute for the DRV8825 carrier when using lower-current stepper motors. The DRV8824 can only deliver up to 0.75 A per coil without a heat sink (1.2 A max with proper cooling), but it has larger current-sense resistors that allow for better microstepping performance than the DRV8825 carrier at low currents. The only way to tell our DRV8824 carrier apart from the DRV8825 carrier is by the markings on the driver IC; if you have a mix of the two, you might consider marking them (there is a blank square on the bottom silkscreen you can use for this).
